title: "G-weighting infrasound data"
description: "Infrasound data captured by devices such as the Raspberry Shake & Boom needs to be G-weighted to properly reflect the sensitivity of the human ear (and body) to the low frequencies present (by definition) in infrasound. This is a technical article documenting some progress in doing this weighting."

One of the challenges of infrasound assessment is that the pressure waveforms recorded by devices like the [Raspberry Shake & Boom](../../shake_and_boom.html) need to be converted in to Sound Pressure levels (SPL) measured on the logarithmic dB scale. There are various types of weighting used for such conversions, the most common being the db(A) weighting scale -- see the chart of commonly-used SPL weightings in the margin.

However, infrasound requires a quite different weighting to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear (and body, as infrasound at high levels can be felt as well as heard). This is called the G weighting scale, and looks like this:

Software to carry our this weighting is not very common. However, after a bit of thought, a simple mechanism to achieve G weighting measurements has been found which does not require any high-level maths to understand. The idea is to create a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in dB(L) of the raw data, then apply the G weighting function to produce an FFT in dB(G).

First I made sure the FFT in Pa was correctly normalised so it represents Pa. That is converted to dB(L), the G weighting is applied to the dB(L) to get dB(G). I've then converted the dB(G) back to Pa as an FFT (red plot in second axes). Now when I sum the FFTs I get a pressure in Pa which does not relate to levels in the signal unfortunately, but I am thinking the difference between these two summed pressures when convert back to dB is the difference overall between dB(L) and dB(G). It's basically assuming the same frequency distribution across the whole sample period, which I think is the best we can hope to do without a real-time weighting circuit behind the microphone as the real SPL meters do. The estimated peak dB(G) is in the bottom right corner just above the peak dB(L). My tests show it works well in narrow band around 10Hz where dB(L) and dB(G) are the same. At this stage I can't see any reason why there'd need to be another scaling factor in there.

This is very much a work in progress. Further useful discussion of the need for G weighting of infrasound SPL data can be found starting at page 59 of [this slightly dated but still very useful review report](../../assets/systematic-review-wind-farms-eh54.pdf).
