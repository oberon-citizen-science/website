::: {.callout-note title="Current status of this initiative"}
Two founding members of OCSN, Alan Sheehan and Tim Churches, both have Raspberry Shake & Boom seismic and infrasound monitoring devices deployed at their properties, about 10-15km south-east of Oberon township and each about 6km apart. Details of how to access the data collected by these two monitoring stations will appear here. That is a good start to a network of such devices located at various points in Oberon LGA.

Although Australia is a geographically stable continent, that does not mean that we do not experience frequent earthquakes...to be continued.
