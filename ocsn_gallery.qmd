## Lava blocks on a beach in Devonport -- Darren Miner

Darren Miner writes about this photo: 

> _I was in Devonport last week, took some lovely beach photos, one of my favourites are these small blocks of lava, from when Australia separated from Africa and Asia about 140 myo (million years ago)._

## Australian eucalyptus longhorn beetle larvae -- Kyla Elizabeth

Kyla Elizabeth contributed these beautiful macro photos: 

> _I found this yesterday whilst splitting wood in O'Connell. Wood is from Queensland. I thought it might be a moth larvae, like a bogong moth or giant wood moth but after seeking advice through some entomology groups it seems it is a longhorn beetle larvae. Most likely a native Australian eucalyptus longhorn beetle. It's fascinating what you find when you take time and look._
