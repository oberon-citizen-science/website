## Lava blocks on a beach in Devonport -- Darren Miner

Darren Miner writes about this photo: 

> _I was in Devonport last week, took some lovely beach photos, one of my favourites are these small blocks of lava, from when Australia separated from Africa and Asia about 140 myo (million years ago)._

## Australian eucalyptus longhorn beetle larvae -- Kyla Ries

Kyla Ries contributed these beautiful macro photos: 

> _I found this yesterday whilst splitting wood in O'Connell. Wood is from Queensland. I thought it might be a moth larvae, like a bogong moth or giant wood moth but after seeking advice through some entomology groups it seems it is a longhorn beetle larvae. Most likely a native Australian eucalyptus longhorn beetle. It's fascinating what you find when you take time and look._

## Rakali (Australian native water rat) caught on camera in Stone Creek, O'Connell -- Kyla Ries

::: {.callout-note title="ABC News article on the elusive rakali"}

A recent article published by ABC News on the rakali, and a call for citizen scientists to log sightings of it, is available [here](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-02/rakali-water-rat-researcher-urges-citizen-science-help/104043350). This is something which OCSN should promote and get involved in!

In this second video, watch towards the end for a flash of the rakali's white tail on the left of the video.

## Platypus in the upper Duckmaloi River -- Tim Churches

Here is a platypus captured at twilight on 24 August 2024 in the upper reaches of the Duckmaloi River, in Chatham Valley, just a few kilometres downstream from its headwaters. Observed for about a minute but only managed to capture a few seconds of video. The river is in partial flood.

## Yellow-footed antechinus, Chatham Valley -- Tim Churches

Almost certainly a [yellow-footed antechinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-footed_antechinus) spotted in our orchard/raspberry patch (no, not a graveyard) video surveillance footage (under surveillance for wallabies eating the plants). The body shape and snout are not right for a rat, nor is the very long tail with a black tip, and it moves with a slight hopping motion. Surprisingly little is known about the various antechinus species, which are no longer very common.

## Antechinus at entrance to a wombat burrow in 2021, Chatham Valley -- Tim Churches

Note the round, bi-lobed ears, the forward-facing eyes and the hopping motion. Not a rat or a mouse. The white thing is a wombat mange treatment flap -- it pours cydectin insecticide on the back of the wombat as it passes underneath, at least in theory. We found they worked maybe 10% of the time, but that was enough to cure our wombat population of mange over the course of about 6 months of weekly or bi-weekly treatments.

## Platypus caught on time lapse camera, upper Duckmaloi River, Chatham Valley -- Tim Churches

Immediate success with my new Brinno TLC300 timelapse camera (a birthday present from my sons but available for OCSN use). On the very first deployment it captured a platypus in the first 10 minutes, but a bit far away. This video is from two days later. Air temperature was -4.5 degress C at 5:30-6:30am when it was captured. You can see its wake as it moves right to left (travelling down stream), then it cruises along the bank in the bottom left of the frame, then does something right underneath the camera, but (damn it) just out of frame, then it swims off down stream again. On a large screen you can see it resurfacing every 10 or 15 metres. At the end of the video are some magnified edits of it swimming along the bank just near the camera. The camera will be redeployed to another pond a few hundred metres down stream. Following that we'll start recording upstream.
