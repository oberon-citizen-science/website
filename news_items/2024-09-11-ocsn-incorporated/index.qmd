We are happy to announce that _Oberon Citizen Science Network_ has now been registered by NSW Fair Trading under the _Associations Incorporation Act 2009_ as an incorporated association. The official registered name is **OBERON CITIZEN SCIENCE NETWORK INCORPORATED** and the registration number is **INC2400977**.

Next steps are to elect officials at the General Meeting scheduled for Friday 20th Septemeber 2024, and then to open a bank account for the association and establish the required record keeping procedures, so that OCSN can accept and handle membership fees, grants and donations, and pay for equipment, venue hire, event insurance and other expenses.
