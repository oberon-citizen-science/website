This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information collected by Oberon Citizen Science Network (OCSN) via the website located at https://oberon-citizen.science, via email accounts associated with OCSN and via other web and social media data collection mechanisms.

## What is "personal information"?

(a) The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) currently defines "personal information" as meaning information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
(i) whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
(ii) whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.
(b) If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified as "personal information" and will not be subject to this privacy policy.
