::: {.callout-note title="Current status of this initiative"}
Two Raspberry Shake and Boom devices capable of detecting the sonic booms made by meteors and space debris have already been deployed just south-east of Oberon township by OCSN founding members. We hope to add several more such monitoring stations to the OCSN network in due course. 

A prototype all-sky camera has been built and commissioned in Chatham Valley by OCSN members. It is still being tested and configured, but you can access the images it captures [here](https://www.ocsn-allsky.net/indi-allsky/). At this stage, we cannot guarantee that the all-sky camera will be operational all of the time, but that is the eventual aim.
