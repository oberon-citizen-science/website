Citizen science (also known as community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, participatory monitoring, or volunteer monitoring) is research conducted with participation from the general public, or amateur/non-professional researchers or participants for science, social science and many other disciplines. There are variations in the exact definition of citizen science, with different individuals and organizations having their own specific interpretations of what citizen science encompasses. Citizen science is used in a wide range of areas of study including ecology, biology and conservation, health and medical research, astronomy, media and communications and information science.

Citizen science has been around since the 1980s, and today there are thousands of citizen science groups around the world, working on and participating in science projects and investigations ranging from collecting data on the local environment and wildlife to very ambitious projects such as [CubeSats](https://csps.aerospace.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/Singh_CitizenSpace_03082019.pdf)[^1].

Closely related to **citizen science** is the concept of [**open science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.
