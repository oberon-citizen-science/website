Perhaps the most contentious and potentially divisive issues to be faced in the immediate future are the proposals to build substantial wind farms in or adjacent to the large pine forests in the southern part of Oberon LGA. Details of these proposed projects are provided below. It is the intention of OCSN to contribute to the debate around these projects and to help inform decision-making processes through projects designed to collect and analyse scientific data of relevance. Some of these potential OCSN initiatives and projects are discussed below.",

    "text": "The proposed Pines Wind Farm\nA very large wind farm development is proposed in the Gurnang, Vulcan and Mount David state forests, which are largely (but not exclusively) pine plantations managed by the Forestry Corporation of NSW. This development has been enabled by recent changes to the relevant NSW legislation pertaining to Forestry Corporation management of state forests, permitting up to 0.7% of state forest softwood plantation areas to be used for renewable energy projects. The developers of the proposed Pines Wind Farm are TAG Energy and Stromlo Energy.\nThe interactive map below shows the exploration area granted to the developers by Forestry Corporation NSW for possible location of the proposed wind farm in (largely) state forest areas. The exploration area is shaded in red, and the existing 500 kVA transmission line to Taralga to which the wind farm must connect shown as a blue line. In early October 2024 the developers released details of the proposed size and layout of the wind farm – they indicated a 2,000 megawatt nameplate capacity comprising 250 turbines up to 300 m high, although only 242 proposed turbine locations were included on the map provided on their web site. Those proposed turbine locations are also shown on the map below. Gazetted protected riparian areas identified by the NSW government for biodiversity protection purposes are also shown (note there are some issues with the GIS files provided by the NSW government for these areas which we are trying to resolve, but the areas shown are accurate, albeit with a few unwanted extra lines).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising the proposed Pines Wind farm using Google Earth Pro\n\n\n\nOCSN has prepared a set of 3D models of the proposed Pines Wind Farm which can be viewed using the free Google Earth Pro software. These models and detailed instructions on how to use them are available here. If you follow the instructions for viewing the models, they will give a reasonable approximation of the visual impact of the proposed wind farm from any given location, if it is built.",

    "text": "OCSN plans which may help inform wind farm decision making processes\nFollowing is a list of potential activities which OCSN may engage in to help inform debate and decision making around wind farm developments. Not all these activities may proceed, it depends on the support for them by OCSN members, and in some cases, on the success of OCSN in obtaining government, philanthropic or other funding to support these initiatives. Collaboration with scientists with particular areas of expertise in universities and research institutes will also be required, and OCSN is actively seeking such partnerships and collaboration with suitable research groups in several of these areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nApart from funding from government grant schemes and philanthropic donors, OCSN intends to seek financial contributions from the wind farm developers themselves, to support projects such as systematic wildlife surveys in and around the proposed wind farm development areas using time-lapse cameras and eco-acoustic technology. We believe that such funding would represent a show of good will and openness on the part of the proposed wind farm developers. However, funding will not be accepted if there are conditions on publication of the results of OCSN investigations, and if all data collected cannot be made openly and publicly available. As a principle, all OCSN funding sources will be clearly listed on this web site – OCSN is committed to openness and transparency.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: An application submitted by OCSN to the August 2024 round of the Pines Wind Farm community funding program was unsuccessful – full details of the application are available here.\n\nReview of the adequacy of scientific data and engineering considerations in the Paling Yards EIS submission, in anticipation of an opportunity for further public input into the decision making processes around this proposed development.\nAssemble a set of informational resources around the science and engineering aspects of wind farm construction and operation.\nDetailed mapping and photographic documentation of the remnant native forest areas in the Pines Wind farm exploration area (see map above). Although the Gurnang, Vulcan and Mount David state forests are predominantly pine plantations, they nevertheless still contain or are bordered by native high country forest cover, particularly along waterways (see the protected riparian areas on the interavtive map above). These native vegetation areas are likely to provide both refuge and transit corridors for native flora and fauna, and thus need to be carefully assessed and be given due consideration when assessing wind farm development proposals. This mapping work may be able to be done as a desktop exercise using high-resolution aerial photograph databases, but on-the-ground validation by OCSN working parties is likely to be needed too.\nDocument the hydrological characteristics of the areas for the proposed wind farms. Wind farms are typically located on higher ground, such as along ridge tops, in order to minimise ground turbulence and maximise the amount of wind power they can harvest. However, such higher areas are also typically the source of streams, creeks and rivers. Given the scale of construction needed for these proposed wind farms – the proposed Pines Wind farm will be the largest, or one of the largest, in Australia – very careful consideration must be given to the impact of such construction on water quality (and volume) in the riparian (river) systems that have their headwaters in or near the areas in which the turbines are proposed to be built. Possible impacts on water quality from accidents during the many decades of operation of these wind farms must also be considered. Such impacts might arise from, for example, oil leaks or spills from the gearboxes in the nacelle of each turbine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAccording to this web page published by a commercial laboratory that specialises in testing lubricants used in wind turbines, a 5MW turbine gearbox contains about 2,600 litres of synthetic lubricant which needs to be chnaged every 9 to 16 months, as well as hydraulic fluids. Multiply that by 250 turbines and the potential for lubricant spill accidents at some stage during the several decades of operational life of the wind farm would seem to be quite high. Exactly how high, and what the consequences of such spill incidents might be on waterways and the wildlife in them (as well as the potential impact on animal and human water supplies) needs very careful investigation.\n\n\n\nStream and water body water quality monitoring. As noted above, because they include some of the highest altitudes in the NSW Central Tablelands, the proposed wind farm areas encompass the headwaters of several creeks and waterways which form or flow into some of the high country rivers which run through Oberon LGA. These headwaters are themselves likely to be ecologically significant, but they also affect the ecology of downstream rivers such as the Duckmaloi, which is known to be one of the very few high country refuges for our nationally-dwindling platypus population. Thus, OCSN will seek to implement water quality monitoring in key waterways likely to be affected by wind farm development, given that the proposed wind farms represent large-scale construction projects involving significant road building and widening, deep foundation excavation and other earthworks which may impact the local riparian environments in ways which timber logging does not. This monitoring will involve periodic water sample collection and analysis, or could involve automated continuous remote monitoring of metrics such as water turbidity, undertaken under the auspices of the NSW government Waterwatch program.\nUndertaking systematic frog population surveys along waterways and water bodies in and around the proposed wind farm areas, in collaboration with the FrogID research team led by Dr Jodi Rowley at the Australian Museum in Sydney. The feasibility of developing automated monitoring devices for key target species will also be examined.\nUndertaking systematic platypus and rakali surveys along waterways and water bodies in and around the proposed wind farm areas, particularly the upper Duckmaloi and Tuglow Rivers, in collaboration with platypus and rakali researchers at several academic instituions. Some examples of successful platypus detection by OCSN in teh upper Duckmaloi River can be found on the Gallery page. See also our platypus and rakali page.\nEstablish a BirdNET monitoring network in Oberon LGA, with particular emphasis in and around the proposed wind farm development areas.\n\nBirdNET appears to be a good solution for monitoring populations of many types of birds, but it is not suitable for monitoring birds-of-prey, which are potentially vulnerable to being affected by wind turbines, since they may occupy the same air space as the spinning turbine blades. Thus, OCSN will seek to evaluate the potential for automated birds-of-prey monitoring as described in this intriguing scientific paper (and/or similar ideas).\n\nProvide an open, freely-accessible zone of visual influence and visual impact analysis facility for the proposed wind farms. The zone of visual influence, sometimes called a reverse or inverse viewshed, is the geographic area from which a development or other structure is theoretically visible, at various sizes. Stromlo Energy, one of the developers of the proposed Pines Wind Farm, has indicated that it plans to provide such a facility to the community through individual consultations. That is fine, but the ability to assess visual impact independent of the wind farm developers is also important, and it is also a potentially interesting and educational community project involving geography, geometry and information technology. Please see the series of blog posts mentioned above for more details.\nInvestigate the audible noise characteristics of wind turbines and, if feasible, develop mathematical modelling capability to estimate noise levels at specific locations.\nDevelop a background noise monitoring program to survey or continuously monitor noise levels in and around the proposed wind farm areas.\nFurther investigation of the capabilities of Raspberry Shake & Boom devices to detect and monitor infrasound generated by wind turbines and other sources. This may involve establishing some positive control monitoring sites near existing wind turbines of the same (or smaller) scale as those proposed for Oberon LGA. The possibility of testing monitoring capability for infrasound generated by the two small, first-generation wind turbines which are visible from Jenolan Caves Road at Hampton will be investigated, if a suitable host site can be found. See also this blog post for a description of work-in-progress on infrasound monitoring.\nRoll out of an expanded Raspberry Shake & Boom (RS&B) device network across Oberon LGA, but with particular emphasis on the areas in and adjacent to the proposed wind farm developments, to monitor baseline and (if the proposals proceed) operational infrasound. The RS&B devices are sensitive enough to detect blasting, rock excavation and even heavy truck movements nearby, which may also be useful during construction phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork-in-progress\n\n\n\nAll this is a work-in-progress, and we welcome other ideas! Please register your expression of interest if you would like to be involved in any of these potential projects.",

    "text": "Distance Zone\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nImmediate Foreground(0 to 0.8 km)\nThe immediate foreground extends to 800 metres from the observer. Within this distance zone, a turbine is the dominant object in the view, when the turbine blades passes its tower an audible rhythmic whooshing sound is created. Observers may have the sensation that a turbine is “looming” over them.\n\n\nForeground(0.8 to 3.2 km)\nThe foreground is determined by the prominence of tree branches and trunks; the analogous parts of wind turbines are the blades and tower. The presence of individual turbines and the movement of the blades attracts and holds an observer’s attention. Turbine sounds may still be noticeable, though it will be substantially reduced as distance increases. In the foreground, some other features in the surrounding landscape may appear to have midground characteristics, even though the wind turbines clearly retain foreground characteristics\n\n\nNear-Midground(3.2 to 8.1 km)\nViewed in the near-midground, multiple visible turbines are perceived as part of a single whole. For instance, the Gestalt principles of similarity and continuity lead us to understand that wind turbines placed along a ridgeline are part of the same wind farm. At night, synchronized red flashing aviation warning lights will also be perceived as a single unit. At this distance it is possible that individual turbines may still have a dominant visual presence; blade movement may still hold a strong visual attraction.\n\n\nFar-Midground(8.1 to 16.1 km)\nIn the far-midground, individual turbines become subordinate to the perception of the wind energy development as a whole. The number of turbines, and the degree to which they extend across the view, determines the visual dominance. When the major portion of a turbine is visible, blade movement is still apparent, but is less able to hold the observer’s attention. In the far-midground, some other features in the surrounding landscape may appear to have background characteristics, even though the wind turbines clearly retain midground characteristics.\n\n\nBackground(16.1 to 32.2 km)\nIndividual turbines and blade movement becomes less obvious, though the presence of a wind energy project may still be visible as part of the overall landscape. This defines the outer extent of the study area."

At this stage, we are seeking expressions of interest from potential members and contributors. Please read on for more information!\nOCSN is a newly formed collective of people living in and around the Oberon local government area (LGA) in the Central Tablelands of NSW who are interested in science and in participating in scientific investigation of interesting and/or important aspects of our environment. By science we mean STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities in general. These include biology and ecology, and the impacts of human activity on those domains, as well as earth science, astronomy and any other safe and non-harmful scientific investigations members may wish to pursue. Projects involving technology and engineering are also in-scope for OCSN, particularly projects involving development of sensor and other methods to study the world around us. Creating peer-reviewed summaries of current scientific findings is also in scope, to help provide reliable and unbiased sources of information about STEM matters which are important to the local community. A list of current and potential activities and projects can be found in the list on the left. This list may expand or contract depending on the interests of OCSN participants.\nParticipants in OCSN do not need to be trained scientists, engineers, technologists or mathematicians – just having an interest in science (or more broadly, STEM) and an allegiance to the scientific method (which is embodied in the OCSN Mission Statement and OCSN Articles of Association for the organisation) is enough. All projects and activities undertaken or promoted by OCSN will include trained scientists and engineers, acting in a voluntary capacity or, in some cases, in academic roles affiliated with universities and research institutes. The idea is to promote and transmit an appreciation of STEM subjects and the scientific method to both OCSN participants and the wider community.\nPlease do read on using the link below or the links at the left to learn more about OCSN and its aims and potential activities.",

Indeed, the entire koala population of Queensland, NSW and the ACT was officially listed as endangered under national environmental law in February 2022.\nThere are anecdotally reports of remnant koala populations in Oberon LGA, and not just in the National Parks areas. Indeed, there are a surprising number of documented koala sightings in the region, recorded in various biodiversity databases, as shown below, some of them recent. However, there appears to be little or no systematic effort to document remaining koala populations in Oberon LGA, and this is a gap which Oberon Citizen Science Network can help to close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical evidence of plentiful koalas around Oberon (click or tap to open)\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical evidence of how plentiful koalas once were around Tarana, which is about 15km north of Oberon township, is provided by this excerpt from an interview with Mick O’Connell on page 44 of the book Living Treasures of Oberon by Mick Joffe (cover and title page also shown below, click or tap on the images for a larger version).

    "text": "Surveying koala populations in Oberon LGA\nThe NSW Government Environment and Heritage web site has some useful information on koala surveys, including the I Spy Koala app for smartphones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the I Spy Koala app\n\n\n\n\n\nThe I Spy Koala app was developed in 2019 by the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water for the collection of koala observation and survey data.\nThe app was part of a pilot designed to improve the flow of koala observation data to NSW planning and decisions tools. All data submitted via the app is made available by the department through the BioNet Atlas, New South Wales’s corporate biodiversity data repository. From there, data is accessible to researchers, land managers, planners, consultants, government and the public via BioNet webpages and associated data services. Once your I Spy Koala data is submitted it will be available in BioNet within approximately 2 weeks.\nThe app has facilities for systematic censuses of koalas in specific areas – OCSN may make use of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Kellie Leigh, CEO of Science for Wildlife, and Groot, her amazing koala scat detection dog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Kellie Leigh, Science for Wildlife\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following notes have been provided by OCSN committee member Richard Harrowell who attended a talk By Dr Kellie Leigh organised by Greening Bathurst on 24th October 2024.\n\nI have just come back from a talk by Dr Kellie Leigh, CEO of Science for Wildlife, based in Mount Victoria, accompanied by her dog Groot. Not too long ago, scientists didn’t think that koalas lived permanently in the Blue Mountains areas, and any koalas they saw were just passing through. This is because of the sandy soil, and the lack of the right kind of eucalypt trees. Since Kellie started her work, they have discovered that koalas are thriving in the area, and they eat the leaves of a far greater variety of eucalypt trees than scientists previously thought. Compared to other koala populations in NSW, the Blue Mountain koalas have the best genetic diversity, the least occurrence of chlamydia, and appear to be increasing in numbers. Science for Wildlife is very interested in sightings of koalas in the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage area, all the way west to Oberon and Mudgee, as well as in the Hawkesbury and Western Sydney areas – particularly sightings on private land. They request that any such sightings be reported on their web site (as well as in other reporting apps such as I Spy Koala described above).\n\n\nThe koala communities go from the Kanangra area up to the Wollemi area. They are currently extending their search up towards Mudgee following some sightings.\n\n\nThe World Heritage area around Blue Mountains extending west to Oberon is over a million hectares, and it is impossible for a small group of scientists to do any kind of comprehensive audit or survey of koala populations in the area. Koala’s in trees in the bush are really hard to see. Kellie relies almost exclusively on Citizen Scientists to make the initial observations to locate a colony. They have so far identified five separate colonies and four of them have been found to have no chlamydia at all. They can tell this by analysing the droppings. Apart from habitat loss, the biggest threat to koalas is dogs that are out at night when the koalas are moving between trees. During the big bushfires of 2019/2020, Kellie’s organisation Science For Wildlife actively removed a large number of the identified colony koalas before the fire passed through in order to save them, re-introducing them after the fire had passed and regrowth had started. They determined that there are no safe areas for koalas during a high-intensity fire.\n\n\nKoalas manage to digest the toxic eucalypt leaves with the help of their gut bacteria, passed to them from their mother. If you move a koala to a different habitat with different trees, it can be really hard for them to adapt as they may not have the right gut bacteria for the new trees.\n\n\nScience for Wildlife is very interested in finding trees that seem to be important to the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area koalas. The way you work it out is by looking for a lot of koala droppings around the tree. These trees may not be the kind of tree you expect a koala to like. These droppings can be olive green or brown if they are older and have a not unpleasant musky eucalyptus smell. If you break them open, the droppings are olive green inside. By contrast, possum droppings just stink.\n\n\nThe droppings are not always easy to see which is why Kellie has trained her dog, Grout, to find the droppings.\n\n\n\n\n\nNovel eco-acoustic survey methods\nRecently ecologists have begun to use eco-acoustic methods for koala surveys. More information about these methods can be found on the OCSN eco-acoustics page. Koalas can be quite vocal animals, particularly male koalas during mating season wen they emit distinctive, low-pitched roars. These roars can be captured using weatherproof, battery powered digital recorders such as the AudioMoth device. OCSN has several such devices at its disposal for deployment around Oberon LGA.\nOne problem with this approach is that many hours of audio recordings then need to be listened to in order to locate any koala roars or other vocalisations, if, in fact, they are present. This is a tedious and potentiall error-prone process – it is easy to miss a roar if attention wanes.\n\n\n\nSeveral groups of researchers are working on or have developed automated methods for detecting koala roars in digital audio files, such as this project at Western Sydney University. Unfortunately none of these projects have made the resulting software or computer code available for use by other researchers. OCSN members are continuing to investigate the availability of computerised methods for screening audio recordings made in potential koala habitats.\nIn the meantime, digital audio recordings made using AudioMoth devices deployed by OCSN in the Oberon LGA will need to be screened by humans listening to the recordings. Fortunately the recordings can easily be divided up and distributed to several individuals to make the task a bit less tedious. Audio screening can also be done via earphones while engaged in other tasks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigiVol\n\n\n\nIt may be possible for Oberon Citizen Science Network to use the DigiVol crowd-sourcing platform operated by the Australian Museum to distrubute the task of listening to audio recordings to volunteers. DigiVol is an online platform which hosts “expeditions”, which are projects for which volunteers can register to under small tasks, such as watching a segment of video recorded by a wildlife or trail camera and noting if any target species appears in the footage. Each participant can undertake as few or as many of these small, discrete tasks as they wish, and as time permits, over the course of the project (expedition). OCSN will contact DigiVol to enquiry about whether they can host audio file screening tasks for us. As well, OCSN members are encouraged to sign up as a DigiVol participant, join an expedition and undertake some tasks!",

The white thing is a wombat mange treatment flap – it pours cydectin insecticide on the back of the wombat as it passes underneath, at least in theory. We found they worked maybe 10% of the time, but that was enough to cure our wombat population of mange over the course of about 6 months of weekly or bi-weekly treatments."

On the very first deployment it captured a platypus in the first 10 minutes, but a bit far away. This video is from two days later. Air temperature was -4.5 degress C at 5:30-6:30am when it was captured. You can see its wake as it moves right to left (travelling down stream), then it cruises along the bank in the bottom left of the frame, then does something right underneath the camera, but (damn it) just out of frame, then it swims off down stream again. Best viewed in HD resolution on a a large screen, you can see it resurfacing every 10 or 15 metres. At the end of the video are some magnified edits of it swimming along the bank just near the camera. The camera will be redeployed to another pond a few hundred metres up stream."

The camera was set to run every evening from 4pm until after dark, one frame every second. It was left there for an entire week. The video here shows all the platypus and rakali sightings in the course of that week of twilight filming. Notably, the platypus, or possible multiple platypuses, are always heading upstream at twilight, whereas in the previous video, they or it appeared to be heading downstream at dawn. A better camera, with better low-light or night-vision performance and the ability to capture over multiple schedules each day is needed – various DIY solutions are being trialled.

    "text": "OCSN plans which may help inform wind farm decision making processes\nFollowing is a list of potential activities in which OCSN may engage to help inform debate and decision making around wind farm developments. Not all these activities may proceed, it depends on the support for their undertaking by potential OCSN members, and in some cases, on the success of OCSN in obtaining government, philanthropic or other funding to support these initiatives. Collaboration with scientists with particular areas of expertise in universities and research institutes will also be required, and OCSN will approach suitable research groups regarding such collaboration in due course.\n\nApart from funding from government grant schemes and philanthropic donors, OCSN intends to seek financial contributions from the wind farm developers themselves, to support projects such as deployment of a network of Raspberry Shake & Boom seismic and infrasound monitoring stations in and around the proposed wind farm development areas. We believe that such funding would represent a show of good will and openness on the part of the proposed wind farm developers. However, funding will not be accepted if there are conditions on publication of the results of OCSN investigations, and if all data collected cannot be made openly and publicly available. As a principle, all OCSN funding sources will be clearly listed on this web site – OCSN is committed to openness and transparency.\n\n\nReview of the adequacy of scientific data and engineering considerations in the Paling Yards EIS submission, in anticipation of an opportunity for further public input into the decision making processes around this proposed development.\nAssemble a set of informational resources around the science and engineering aspects of wind farm construction and operation.\nInvestigate the audible noise characteristics of wind turbines and, if feasible, develop mathematical modelling capability to estimate noise levels at specific locations.\nDevelop a background noise monitoring program to survey or continuously monitor noise levels in and around the proposed wind farm areas.\nFurther investigation of the capabilities of Raspberry Shake & Boom devices to detect and monitor infrasound generated by wind turbines and other sources. This may involve establishing some positive control monitoring sites near existing wind turbines of the same (or smaller) scale as those proposed for Oberon LGA. The possibility of testing monitoring capability for infrasound generated by the two small, first-generation wind turbines which are visible from Jenolan Caves Road at Hampton will be investigated, if a suitable host site can be found. See also this blog post for a description of work-in-progress on infrasound monitoring.\nRoll out of an expanded Raspberry Shake & Boom (RS&B) device network across Oberon LGA, but with particular emphasis on the areas in and adjacent to the proposed wind farm developments, to monitor baseline and (if the proposals proceed) operational infrasound. The RS&B devices are sensitive enough to detect blasting, rock excavation and even heavy truck movements nearby, which may also be useful during construction phases.\nDetailed mapping and photographic documentation of the remnant native forest areas in the Pines Wind farm exploration area (see map above). Although the Gurnang and Vulcan state forests are predominantly pine plantations, they nevertheless still contain or are bordered by native high country forest cover, particularly along waterways. This native vegetation areas are likely to provide both refuge and transit corridors for native flora and fauna, and thus need to be carefully assessed and be given due consideration when assessing wind farm development proposals. This mapping work may be able to be done as a desktop exercise using high-resolution aerial photograph databases, but on-the-ground validation by OCSN working parties is likely to be needed too.\nUndertaking systematic frog population surveys along waterways and water bodies in and around the proposed wind farm areas, in collaboration with the FrogID research team led by Dr Jodi Rowley at the Australian Museum in Sydney. The feasibility of developing automated monitoring devices for key target species will also be examined.\nEstablish a BirdNET monitoring network in Oberon LGA, with particular emphasis in and around the proposed wind farm development areas.\n\nBirdNET appears to be a good solution for monitoring populations of many types of birds, but it is not suitable for monitoring birds-of-prey, which are potentially vulnerable to being affected by wind turbines, since they may occupy the same air space as the spinning turbine blades. Thus, OCSN will seek to evaluate the potential for automated birds-of-prey monitoring as described in this intriguing scientific paper (and/or similar ideas).\n\nStream and water body water quality monitoring. Because they include some of the highest altitudes in the NSW Central Tablelands, the proposed wind farm areas encompass the headwaters of several creeks and waterways which form or flow into some of the high country rivers whicvh run through Oberon LGA. These headwaters are themselves likely to be ecologically significant, but they also affect the ecology of downstream rivers such as the Duckmaloi, which is known to be one of the very few high country refuges for our nationally-dwindling platypus population. Thus, OCSN will seek to implement water quality monitoring in key waterways likely to be affected by wind farm development, given that the proposed wind farms represent large-scale construction projects involving significant road building and widening, deep foundation excavation and other earthworks which may impact the local riparian environments in ways which timber logging does not. This monitoring may involve periodic water sample collection and analysis, or could involve automated continuous remote monitoring of metrics such as water turbidity.\nProvide an open, freely-accessible zone of visual influence and visual impact analysis facility for the proposed wind farms. The zone of visual influence, sometimes called a reverse or inverse viewshed, is the geographic area from which a development or other structure is theoretically visible, at various sizes. Stromlo Energy, one of the developers of the proposed Pines Wind Farm, has indicated that it plans to provide such a facility to the community through individual consultations. That is fine, but the ability to assess visual impact independent of the wind farm developers is also important, and it is also a potentially interesting and educational community project involving geography, geometry and information technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind farm visual impact assessment capability work-in-progress\n\n\n\n\n\nOberon Citizen Science Network is working on developing state-of-the-art capabilities for assessing the visual impact of proposed wind farms. The first four in a series of blog posts documenting these development efforts are available in the Blog posts section of this web site.\n\n\n\nWe welcome other ideas! Please register your expression of interest if you would like to be involved in any of these potential projects."

    "text": "Oberon Citizen Science Network has a growing network of bird call monitors to detect what birds are around. The beauty of these detectors is they work all the time, day and night, and you don’t have to be able to see the bird. While it doesn’t replace actually seeing a bird as a detection method, it certainly complements it, and rare bird detections can encourage active birdwatching to detect those rare species. Because these monitors collect data continuously, they also permit time-series analysis to examine the effect of daily and short-term weather, the seasons, and even climate change on the prevalence of bird calls detected for each species. Background information on these monitoring devices, which use advanced machine learning (AI) algorithms, can be found here, and a review of the commercial variant of these devices can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BirdNET-Pi logo\n\n\nInitially the network started with a DIY BirdNET-Pi monitoring station in Chatham Valley, then extended to a Birdweather PUC in Butterfactory Lane and now includes another BirdNET-Pi on the Reef Road. Further stations are planned to be installed soon, so the network is growing.\nThe reports below summarise the detections at each station by day and by time of day. From these reports we can see when birds enter, leave or move around the area, through migration or nomadic feeding, and we can also see what time of day they are vocal, which highlights especially nocturnal feeders like owls which are often hard to find and spot.\nThe data from each station is continuously fed to the BirdNET database at Cornell University where it can be used by anyone to study the behaviour and prevalence of birds. It is also available through the Birdweather website. You can even listen to recordings of each bird call detected at each site through the Birdweather web site map!\nThe custom reports shown here are produced by exporting the data from Birdweather for each of our stations,and then using some python code to produce these reports. As you can see from the combined stations reports (OCSN Oberon LGA 2409) we are rapidly approaching the limits of the current report format, so some further research and development of the reports will be required as we expand the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note for nerds\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Oberon Citizen Science Network web site is hosted for free by GitHub using the fantastic GitHub pages facility. Recently, Oberon Citizen Science Network applied for not-for-profit philanthropic account status from GitHub, which it has just been awarded. This will allow us to build automated data reporting facilities for data sources such at the OCSN BirdNET-pi/Birdweather network of monitoring stsations, and the OCSN network of Raspberry Shake & Boom seismic and infrasound monitoring stations, using the GitHub Actions facility which is now available to us with our upgraded account status.

The degree of overlap can be examined by toggling each independent viewshed on and off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compound viewshed is formed by simply taking the union of each of the independent, individual viewsheds at each pixel. In other words, if 0 means no visible and 1 means visible, for each pixel in the raster map we check if any of the independent viewshed have a 1 and if so, we set the compound viewshed value for that pixel to be 1, otherwise it is set to 0. We won’t bother illustrating the simple compound viewshed here, because there are more interesting versions of it which can be readily calculated."

In fact, the turbines that may be used in the proposed windfarms south of Oberon are likely to be considerably larger than the GE 5.3–158 wind turbine. The EIS for the proposed Palings Yard wind farm mentions turbines up to 240 metres high, and initial information released by the proponents of the proposed Pines wind farm mentions turbines up to 300 metres high. The parameters described below to calculate visual impact would need to be adjusted to reflect larger turbine size.\nNote that although the exact details of the Palings Yard turbine sizes have not been decided (or that information was not included in the EIS), the number of proposed turbines and their proposed locations are known and that information has been used here."

    "text": "Steps in implementing the Palmer visual impact assessment metrics\n\nDistance zones\nAn intuitively obvious factor which affects wind turbine visual impact is the distance of the observer from the turbine. We have seen in earlier blog posts in this series how distance can readily be calculated. Palmer suggests using a graded set of distance zones, as described in the table below, rather than a continuous distance metric, primarily for computaional reasons. The distances are specific for the GE 5.3–158 wind turbine and would need to be adjusted for larger or smaller turbines. Note that these distance zones were also used in the previous parts of this series of blog posts on visual impact assessment.\n\nDescription of distance zones for the GE 5.3–158 wind turbine, reproduced from Table 1 in Palmer (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Zone\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nImmediate Foreground(0 to 0.8 km)\nThe immediate foreground extends to 800 metres from the observer. Within this distance zone, a turbine is the dominant object in the view, when the turbine blades passes its tower an audible rhythmic whooshing sound is created. Observers may have the sensation that a turbine is “looming” over them.\n\n\nForeground(0.8 to 3.2 km)\nThe foreground is determined by the prominence of tree branches and trunks; the analogous parts of wind turbines are the blades and tower. The presence of individual turbines and the movement of the blades attracts and holds an observer’s attention. Turbine sounds may still be noticeable, though it will be substantially reduced as distance increases. In the foreground, some other features in the surrounding landscape may appear to have midground characteristics, even though the wind turbines clearly retain foreground characteristics\n\n\nNear-Midground(3.2 to 8.1 km)\nViewed in the near-midground, multiple visible turbines are perceived as part of a single whole. For instance, the Gestalt principles of similarity and continuity lead us to understand that wind turbines placed along a ridgeline are part of the same wind farm. At night, synchronized red flashing aviation warning lights will also be perceived as a single unit. At this distance it is possible that individual turbines may still have a dominant visual presence; blade movement may still hold a strong visual attraction.\n\n\nFar-Midground(8.1 to 16.1 km)\nIn the far-midground, individual turbines become subordinate to the perception of the wind energy development as a whole. The number of turbines, and the degree to which they extend across the view, determines the visual dominance. When the major portion of a turbine is visible, blade movement is still apparent, but is less able to hold the observer’s attention. In the far-midground, some other features in the surrounding landscape may appear to have background characteristics, even though the wind turbines clearly retain midground characteristics.\n\n\nBackground(16.1 to 32.2 km)\nIndividual turbines and blade movement becomes less obvious, though the presence of a wind energy project may still be visible as part of the overall landscape. This defines the outer extent of the study area.\n\n\n\nTo implement this, a raster layer for the distance from each of the 47 proposed Palings Yard turbines to each point in the surrounding landscape is calculated, and these distances are then categorised into the five distance zones described above, represented by intgers 1 (immediate) to 5 (background).\n\n\nVisual exposure\nThe visual impact of a wind turbine on any point in the surrounding landscape depends on several factors, such as distance, and whether it can be seen at all – the binary viewshed – but also on how much of each turbine can be seen – that is, the visual exposure of each turbine when seen from each point in the surrounding landscape (with zero visual exposure being outside the viewshed for the turbine).\nPalmer (2022) provides the following table of visual exposure grades, together with the logic behind them. The grades of exposure are also illustrated here (click to enlarge the graphic).\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual exposure grades for wind turbines, from Palmer (2022)\n\n\n\nVisual exposure targets for wind turbines, reproduced from Table 2 in Palmer (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBlade End\nThe last 10 metres of the blade seems sufficient to be recognizable through the foreground and into the midground distance. If it is just this 10 metre segment, then as the blade rotates it will rise into view and disappear before another blade end appears. The visibility analysis includes the full blade up to 10 metres from the tip. This means that there is the possibility to see two blades moving, but not their connection at the hub. Experience and research indicate that the blade end is noticeable with a visual impact up to 8.0 km from the observer.\n\n\nTurbine Hub\nThis is the second most common target in a visibility analysis. At a minimum, the observer can see portions of the nacelle and at least two full blades connected at the hub. This minimum visibility may seem to be somewhat disconnected and “floating” to the observer, but it becomes more noticeable as a larger proportion of the rotor sweep becomes visible. Experience and research indicate that the turbine hub is noticeable with a visual impact up to 16.1 km from the observer.\n\n\nRotor Sweep\nThe rotating blades are the most distinctive part of a wind turbine; they are moving and the area they sweep is almost 2 hectares. It is proposed that a wind turbine is readily recognised if one can see all but the last 10 metres of the downward blade. The full turbine visibility includes this sweep down to the ground. Experience and research indicate that the rotor sweep is noticeable with a visual impact up to 32.2 km from the observer.\n\n\n\nTo calculate this, we compute three viewshed layers for each of the turbines in the wind farm which is to be assessed. Separate viewsheds for each of three different degrees of exposure for each turbine – that is, whether only the tips of the upper blade arc can be seen, at a minimum height above the terrain of 170.5 metres, whether the hub (nacelle) of the wind turbine can be seen, at a minimum height above the terrain of 101.5 metres, or whether the entire blade arc can be seem, at a minimum height of 32.5 metres above the terrain.\nAs noted above, these visual exposure heights are specific for the GE 5.3–158 wind turbine used by Palmer as an example, and would need to be adjusted for the actual turbine types in a specifc wind farm.\nThus, for the Palings Yard wind farm, comprising 47 turbines, we compute 3x47=141 separate viewsheds to take into account the degree of visual exposure for each turbine at each point in the landscape.\nEach of these viewsheds contains a binary (0, 1) indicator of turbine visibility at blade end, hub or full rotor sweep heights, at each point in the landscape. This binary indicator to multiplied by factors of 10, 20 and 30 for the blade end, hub and full rotor sweep viewsheds respectively.\nOne difference from the worked example provided by Palmer is that we have not used land cover data in addition to elevation data here – we assume a bare-earth model, as recommended in the NSW government guidelines for visual impact assessment. If land cover information is used in viewshed calculations, two elevation models must be used – one for the bare-earth terrain elevation, and another which adds vegetation (and buildings) height to that terrain elevation, based on land cover data. The reason why a single elevation model which sums terrain elevation with land cover heights cannot be used is because otherwise the observer at each point in the landscape would effectively be observing the target wind turbines from, in the case of forested areas, the tops of the trees. This is unlikely. The viewshed calculation functions in the terra library for R used in these blog posts does not allow for the use of two such elevation models, with and without land cover heights, and it is not entirely clear that the ESRI software used by Palmer does either. Thus we have set any use of land cover data aside, at least for now. As mentioned previously, this make the viewsheds and any resulting visual impact assessments err on the side of conservatism – that is, it provides a worst case analysis, which is arguably good practice in any case.\n\n\nCalculating the adjusted visual prominence for an entire wind farm\nThis is done in four steps as follows.\n\nVisual prominence\nThe first step described by Palmer is to reclassify the distance zone and visual exposure data, for each turbine, into a visual prominence score, according to the table shown below. Palmer provides a detailed justification for this prominence score in his paper. This gives us 47 rasters, one for each turbine. These 47 rasters are then summed, giving a single raster with a total visual prominence score at each location in the raster – that is, at each location in the landscape.\n\nThe rating of individual turbine visual prominence based on distance zone and visual exposure, reproduced from Table 3 in Palmer (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Zone\nDistance Range (km)\nVisual Exposure\n\n\nEnd\nHub\nSweep\n\n\n\n\nImmediate\n0.0 – 0.8\n4\n7\n10\n\n\nForeground\n0.8 – 3.2\n2\n4\n6\n\n\nNear-midground\n3.2 – 8.0\n1\n2\n4\n\n\nFar-midground\n8.0 – 16.1\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nBackground\n16.1 – 32.2\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaningful visibility\nIn the second step. the coded visual exposure values in the individual turbine rasters described above are also reclassified according to the following meaningful visibility table. These meaningful visibility viewshed are summed for each pixel in the rasters – that is, for each point in the entire study area landscape – to give a raster layer for the wind farm’s cumulative meaninful visibity at each point in the study area.\n\nDetermining meaningful visibility based on distance zone and visual exposure, reproduced from Table 4 in Palmer (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Zone\nDistance Range (km)\nVisual Exposure\n\n\nEnd\nHub\nSweep\n\n\n\n\nImmediate\n0.0 – 0.8\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nForeground\n0.8 – 3.2\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nNear-midground\n3.2 – 8.0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nFar-midground\n8.0 – 16.1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nBackground\n16.1 – 32.2\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nMean visual prominence\nIn the third step the total visual prominence layer is divided by the meaningful visible turbines layer to give a mean visual prominence score per turbine at each pixel (point) in the study area.\n\n\nAdjusted mean visual prominence\nThe the final, fourth step, the mean visual prominence of the wind farm at each point in the surrounding study area landscape is multiplied by an adjusted number of meaningfully visible turbines, to account for the decreasing incremental contribution of each additional turbine in a wind farm to the overall visual impact. Palmer justifies this adjustment as follows:\n\nThe sum of the individual turbines’ visual prominence is a measure of visual impact that accounts for the effects of exposure and distance, but weighs the contribution of all the turbines equally. However, it is generally recognized that the incremental contribution of each addition turbine decreases as the extent of the project [wind farm] increases. So far there is little research about the shape of this function and no research involving the large number of turbines (n) with a mixture of visual exposures and distance zones. This study investigates using the square root of n, the cube root of n, and the natural log of (n + 1) to represent project exposure or the decreasing incremental contribution of turbines to the overall visual impact.\n\nThis adjusted number of meaningfully visible turbines is multiplied by the mean visual prominence to give the final visual impact metric for the wind farm being evaluated, at each point in the surrounding landscape."

That paper seems to be well-regarded and is a good starting point for exploration of better metrics for assessing the visual impact of wind farms than those outlined in the official guidelines.\nIn future steps we can drape the overall visual impact metric raster over 3D rendered maps with animated fly-arounds to provide an alternative visualistion. Weighting of visual impact metrics by population density at each point would also possible to allow an approximate overall human population-based visual impact score to be created for a given configuration of wind turbines (and variations of that for specific locations or sets of locations). That would then allow the visual impact of different turbine layouts and numbers to be compared and optimised to reduce visual impact to a minimum (subject to other optimisation constraints). Of course, the visual impact of turbines in not limited only to where people live, and thus incorporation of information about other significant viewpoints in the landscape surround wind farms would need to be incorporated – for example, although no-one (or very few people) live in National Parks, the visual impact of a wind farm on locations in that National Park is arguably greater, or more important, than the visual impact on farm or grazing land that is unoccupied by humans. Some thought needs to be given to this, for the purposes of optimising wind farm configuration with respect to visual impact.\nIn a forthcoming blog post we will also compare the visual impact assessment performed here using the methodology described in Palmer (2022) with the visual impact asessment submitted as part of the 2023 Palings Yard wind farm EIS."

More recently, the ability to also monitor and record infrasound (very low frequency sound waves, mostly below the frequencies which humans can hear) has been added to these devices, allowing the deep rumbles caused by earthquakes to be detected, as well as other sources of infrasound, incuding aircraft, wind blowing through forests, wind turbines and sonic booms from meteorites entering the earth’s atmosphere.

As you can see, an RS&B station in Oberon LGA can readily detect earthquakes thousands of kilometres away.\n\n\n\nRecording of a recent earthquake near Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, as recorded by the Raspberry Shake & Boom monitoring station operated by Alan Sheehan just south of Oberon township\n\n\n\n\nDetecting local earthquakes\nOf course, the devices can also detect , less intense local earthquakes, as shown below.\n\n\n\nRecording of the earthquake south of Leura on 8 March 2024, as captured near Oberon by Alan Sheehan using a Raspberry Shake & Boom device\n\n\n\n\nMeteorite and space debris sonic booms\nMeteorites and space debris enter the Earth’s atmospshere at supersonic speeds, creating sonic booms from the resulting shock wave. On the morning of August 9, 2022 at 7:05am the SpaceX Crew 1 Dragon Trunk re-entered the atmosphere over Western NSW, the Snowy Mountains and eastern Victoria. This is the infrasound signal of that event captured on a Raspberry Shake and Boom operated by Alan Sheehan just outside Oberon, some 370kms away from the point of closest approach.\n\n\n\nSpaceX trunk re-entry infrasound signal 2022\n\n\n\n\nDIY data analysis\nWith a little program code, using the Python programming language, you can fully explore the capabilities of your Raspberry Shake and Boom. Don’t worry - we are happy to share code and help you to learn how to do it. Shown below is a custom analysis of an earthquake in Honshu, Japan, programmed by Alan Sheehan.\n\n\n\nCustom analysis of Honshu earthquake programmed by Alan Sheehan\n\n\n\n\nInfrasound\nBelow is the infrasound signal of a passing helicopter, showing the Doppler shift in frequencies as it first approaches then receeds from the monitoring Raspeberry Shake and Boom device. You don’t need any coding skill for this type of report either - its available from the Raspberry Shake Data View web app and you can join and use any or all the Raspberry Shakes in the world for free (you don’t even have to own one!), via the ShakeNet web site.\n\n\n\nHelicopter infrasound\n\n\n\n\nWind turbine infrasound\n\n\nIt should be born in mind that merely detecting infrasound generated by wind turbines does not necessarily imply that that infrasound has impacts on human (and/or non-human) health, or even that humans and other animals can detect it. Nonetheless, we beleive that it is important to develop capabilities to monitor such artifical sources of infrasound, as well as natural sources such as wind blowing through trees and sound generated by fast flowing water in river rapids, and to collect baseline data before any proposed wind turbines are constructed, as well as after they become operational. OCSN also intends to undertake a meta-review of articles and reports which review and summarise the scientific evidence around the effect of infrasound on human health and the broader ecology.\nThe infrasound microphone in the Raspberry Shake and Boom device should be able to detect infrasound generated by wind turbines. Not much work has been done yet to fully investigate and validate these capabilities, and further investigation of this will be one of the initial projects to be undertaken by OCSN. However, if the infrasound data from a Raspberry Shake and Boom deployed at Koroit, which is near Warrnambool in Victoria and close to several large wind farms, is processed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), some interesting features become evident in the resulting spectrograms. We suspect the spikes in the FFT spectrums shown below are tonal frequencies from laminar boundary layer, blunt trailing edges and/or flow over holes, slits and intrusions in nearby wind towers. It shows the potential capability of the RSnB to continuously monitor infrasound generated by wind turbines at a range of distances, although this very preliminary work still needs to be carefully validated.",

    "text": "Frogs and Wind farms\nOne of the reasons why it is so important to monitor frog populations is that they can be very vulnerable to human development and land use changes. For example, there is a proposed development of a large wind turbine farm at Paling Yards, which is in the catchment area of the Abercrombie River. There has been little or no consideration of the effect of wind farm development on the Booroolong frog in the Paling Yards development EIS (environmental impact statement). In fact, the Biodiversity Development Assessment Report for the Paling Yards Wind Farm notes on page 44 that no Booroolong frogs were recorded within 10km of the proposed development area, which appears to be at odds with data collected by the FrogID project. There is clearly a role for local OCSN citizen scientists, working in collaboration with FrogID scientists, to check these facts.\nThere are also many other vulnerable or threatened species listed in the Biodiversity Assessment Report for Paling Yards, including many bird species. There is a role for OCSN members to collect more data to better inform such environmental impact assessments – see also the proposed BirdNET sensor project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction ahead\n\n\n\nThe proposed Pines Wind Farm in state forests south of Oberon also has the potential to impact vulnerable frog populations, and developing OCSN projects to collect essential baseline data while that proposal is still in the investigation phase should be a priority project for OCSN.",

    "text": "OCSN application unsuccessful\n\n\n\nOberon Citizen Science Network received the following communication from the Pines Wind farm developers on Tuesday 1st October 2024 regarding the application for community funding as detailed below:\n\nHi Alan,\nThank you for taking the time to submit a sponsorship application.\nThe sponsorship committee has finalised its selection and unfortunately your application was not selected from the many that were submitted.\nIf you have any questions, please let us know and one of the selection committee team can be in touch.\nKind regards,\nThe Pines Wind Farm Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a copy of the application OCSN submitted to the August 2024 round of the Pines Wind Farm project community sponsorship program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe application was prepared after carefully reviewing the guidelines and elegibility criteria as instructed on the Pines Wind Farm project community sponsorship program web page. The document containing the elegibility criteria and guidelines can be found here.\nUnfortunately, when submitting our application via the provided online submission form, an additional elegibility criterion was discovered: that organisations applying must have been in existence for at least 12 months. This requirement was not mentioned in the elegibility and application guidelines document mentioned above, nor anywhere else that we can determine.\nWe hope that this additional elegibility requirement, which was disclosed only at submission time and only in the online form, is a mistake, for the following reasons:\n\nit represents an inconsistency between the two pathways provided for submitting applications, since the requirement is not mentioned or revealed at all when submitting an application by emailing the provided PDF application form;\nit penalises innovation and new initiatives in the community; and\nit is a blunt and clumsy way of discouraging opportunistic or bad-faith applications.\n\nOCSN has requested clarification from the Pines Wind Farm organisation.\n\n\n\n\nName of the initiative:\n\nSurveying wildlife prevalence in Oberon LGA using eco-acoustics and time-lapse photography\n\n\n\nProvide a short overview of your initiative:\n\nThe Oberon local government area, in the NSW Central Tablelands, contains many increasingly rare sub-alpine environments at elevations between 1000 and 1350 metres, including the headwaters and upper reaches of several river systems which are host to endangered and threatened species, and habitats for a range of cold-tolerant flora and fauna. Remarkably little data is collected in a systematic or ongoing fashion to monitor the prevalence of fauna in the region. There is surprisingly little published scientific research, specific to the region, on key species, and much of what is available is decades old. Similarly fauna records for the region in databases such as the NSW BioNet Atlas are sparse and most are not recent. The recently-formed Oberon Citizen Science Network (OCSN) seeks to address these knowledge gaps, in partnership with academic researchers and other ecological and conservation organisations, by developing a series of science-based, systematic fauna survey projects to be carried out by its members, most of whom live in the region. We plan to use modern, technological means to efficiently conduct these surveys, in particular eco-acoustic methods and automated visual monitoring using time-lapse cameras. These devices will be deployed to, and retrieved from, survey sites by OCSN members, and the data so collected analysed by teams of OCSN members using both automated and semi-manual methods. All data and results will be made publicly available, with outreach to local schools to involve students in projects to use or analyse the data. Co-authorship of formal scientific papers by OCSN and its academic partners may also be possible.\n\n\n\nTotal sponsorship funding for the application:\n\n$3950\n\n\n\nTiming of the initiative:\n\n1 October 2024 to 30 June 2026\n\n\n\nOrganisation name:\n\nOberon Citizen Science Network (OCSN)\n\n\n\nABN/ACN\n\nTBA\n\n\n\nLength of time the organisation has been operating:\n\nFour months\n\n\n\nShort overview of your organisation:\n\nOberon Citizen Science Network (OCSN) is a strictly non-political volunteer organisation for people interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects, projects and promotion in the community. An application for incorporation of OCSN as a not-for-profit association has been submitted to Service NSW and approval is expected in September 2024. Further organisational details may be found on the OCSN web site. At the time of writing in late August 2024, OCSN has 28 members.\n\n\n\nWhich category best describes your organisation:\n\nCommunity organisation, not-for-profit\n\n\nContact name:\nAddress:\nPhone number:\nEmail:\n\nLocation of the funding initiative / Distance from The Pines Wind Farm proposal site:\n\n0 to 50 kms\n\n\n\nWhich category best describes your initiative:\n\nEducation and Training, Environment\n\n\n\nDescribe how the initiative will benefit the local community:\n\nFor the members of OCSN participating in this initiative, it will build knowledge and appreciation of local fauna and increase awareness of the challenges faced by specific species in the face of ecological changes. It will also expose participants to modern, technology-based ecological survey methods, including field workshops in sensor operation and deployment, and training sessions in data analysis and data dissemination methods using free, open-source software. A significant number of OCSN members live in the southern part of Oberon LGA, adjacent to the Pines exploration areas, and have close ties to their local communities.\n\n\nThere will be three technologies used in this initiative:\n\n\n\nAudioMoth digital eco-acoustic recorders – these small, open-source devices are capable of recording up to several weeks of high fidelity audio using just battery power. They come with a very good custom waterproof case. Typically they are deployed in hidden locations at target sites, left for a week or two, then collected and the recordings downloaded from them for further processing and analysis. The devices are widely used and well-regarded worldwide in eco-acoustic survey research. OCSN already owns two of these devices and has been testing (with success) them for frog, bird and bat call capture. Details of proposed analysis methods for the captured recordings are given in the next section.\n\n\n\n\nBrinno time lapse cameras – these cameras are often used on construction sites, but they are also ideal for capturing timelapse videos in natural environments. Recent research found that human reviewers could screen an hour’s worth of photographs of ponds and river segments taken every 3 second in just one minute with very good accuracy in identifying potential platypus movements. Candidate movements are then examined in detail, frame by frame to verify sightings. The task of reviewing such timelapse footage can be distributed to several OCSN members or other volunteers, after suitable training, to make larger scale surveys feasible.\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi and Birdweather bird call identification stations – these are descibed in section 17.g below.\n\n\n\nBeyond the direct participation by OCSN members, this initiative will:\n\n\n\nincrease community knowledge of and pride in our sub-alpine local habitat and the fauna which are part of it;\n\n\n\n\nprovide current and ongoing data on fauna prevalence in various habitats for use in school projects, and as the basis for further scientific investigation and analyses;\n\n\n\n\nprovide an example and motivation to school students to promote interest in STEM subjects and careers. Through the use of modern technological means for data collection, this initiative will appeal not only to students with an interest in biology or ecology, but also students (and community members) interested in embedded microprocessor devices and related technologies, engineering, statistical analysis and information technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll data collected by the initiative will be made freely available via the OCSN web site and local schools will be encouraged to develop learning projects or individual student projects (eg for the Investigating Science HSC school subject). Several OCSN members are teachers at local schools in Oberon LGA.\n\n\n\nDescribe how the initiative will benefit the broader community beyond the organisation/program being funded:\n\nThis initiative seeks to promote interest in STEM in the wider community by adding to the extent and currency of data and knowledge on fauna and habitat in the Oberon region, by actively disseminating and publicising the results of fauna surveys undertaken through this initiative. Dissemination will be via the OCSN web site, social media (including local community groups on Facebook, as well as OCSN YouTube and TikTok channels) and community meetings, including a 2025 National Science Week STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and maths) event at the Malachi Gilmore Hall in Oberon for which NSW and Commonwealth government science week community event funding will be sought. The intent is to engender in the wider community both greater awareness of and pride in the local natural environment, as well as promoting Oberon LGA as a centre of excellence in citizen science and STEM educational engagement.\n\n\nThe initial focus of this initiative will be on surveying the prevalence of the following endangered, threatened and near-threatened species, both because there has been so little recent research done on them in the local region, and because there are already wider (but not local) research and/or conservation efforts for them, with which OCSN can partner:\n\n\n\nKoala: eco-acoustic monitoring for male koala mating roars, starting in and around the known remnant population of koalas in the Oberon LGA outside of national park areas, and then extending to other likely habitats, in consultation with the National Koala Monitoring Program – see also the information they provide on their audio monitoring methodology, which OCSN will adopt.\n\n\n\n\nPlatypus: direct observation surveys at likely locations, as well as systematic deployment along waterway courses of time-lapse cameras, which have recently been shown to be an excellent method for platypus detection over longer periods (one to two weeks at a time, as detailed in this recent scientific paper). The initial focus will be on the Duckmaloi River, once famous for its abundant platypus population, in particular the upper reaches of the Duckmaloi and the headwater riparian systems which feed into it, as well as parts of the Fish River and tributaries further north in Oberon SLA. These surveys will be designed and undertaken based on advice from the Australian Platypus Conservancy) and the UNSW Platypus Conservation Initiative. All data collected will be contributed to the Australian Platypus Conservancy and through the platy-project web site, both of which in turn contribute data to the NSW BioNet Atlas. Video of a recent platypus sighting in the upper reaches of the Duckmaloi River by an OCSN member can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nRakali (native water rat): rakali will also be surveyed using the same methods and equipment as the platypus surveys outlined above, initially as part of the platypus surveys given that their habitats are very similar. We will engage with the Australian Platypus Conservancy rakali project for advice.\n\n\n\n\nBooroolong frog: this frog species, which lives exclusively in rocky sections of high country rivers and creeks, is classed as critically endangered. There are known populations of this frog in Oberon LGA in the Sewells Creek riparian system near Essington and in the Abercrombie River system. In 2012 the NSW government published a national recovery plan for the species which listed several other known habitats for this frog in the Oberon region, including the upper reaches of the Fish River and the Duckmaloi Rivers. The plan called for regular monitoring of the populations in those areas, but it appears this was never done. OCSN plans to remedy this but undertaking systematic eco-acoustic surveys of the areas in the southern part of Oberon LGA identified in the recovery plan, using the equipment and methods decribed in section 16 above. The surveys will be planned in conjunction with herpetologists at the FrogID project located at the Australian Museum and UNSW, with particular regard to protection of possible Booroolong frog habitats from inadvertent introduction of the chytrid fungus pathogen through appropriate footwear hygiene and minimal impact monitoring using eco-acoustic devices rather than traditional but potentially distruptive direct observation methods.\n\n\n\n\nOther frog species: the surveys outlined in d. above will also be able to detect and estimate the prevalence of many other local frog species, some of which are threatened or known to be in decline, others still thriving. However this will require development and testing of automated methods for frog call recognition. We will partner with several research groups around Australia are developing such methods, including the Arthur Rylah Institute in Victoria (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBR2yQR2ilw ).\n\n\n\n\nBat species: although microbat species in the Oberon region are not thought to be endangered or threatened, there is little awareness of them or their prevalance apart from when they roost in dwellings. This is largely due to their nocturnal habits and their predominantly ultrasonic echo-location calls. This iniative also seeks to develop and demonstrate the ability to detect microbat presence in forest environments through capture of their ultrasonic calls. This will be done with the same AudioMoth recording devices used for other aspects of this project – these devices are capable of sound sampling at a 384kHz rate and thus can readily capture the typical range of ultrasonic calls emitted by Australian microbats. The data will be analysed using the bat call recognition software developed and published by the Australian company Titley Scientific, a world leader in ecoacoustics. Several OCSN members are currently attending a series of training seminars in bat call detection provided by Titley. At a later date some Titley hardware devices may also be acquired if funding can be found, but not as part of this funding application.\n\n\n\n\nBird species: several OCSN members have experience with deployment of Birdweather or BirdNET-pi bird monitoring devices at their homes or properties. This system, developed by Cornell University in the US, uses an advanced machine learning algorithm trained on the calls of thousands of bird species worldwide (including nearly a thousand Australian species) to automatically identify bird species from their calls as captured by the devices. The algorithm has been shown in the scientific literature to be extremely accurate, which is confirmed by the anecdotal experience to date of OCSN members. Part of this initiative is to subsidise the installation of several more Birdweather or BirdNET-pi devices at the homes of OCSN members, in the townships as well as rural locations. All Birdweather and BirdNEt-pi devices contribute data to the Birdweather network, and the data is then freely available for others to use. In addition, OCSN will separately collate, analyse and publish data from these Oberon SLA monitoring devices in a way that makes it even easier for the Oberon community to view, and for school students to access for projects.\n\n\n\nOne limitation of the Birdweather and BirdNet-pi devices is that they carry out evaluation of the convolutional neural network model they use for call identification on the device, and this means they require several watts of power. Although this is negligible in the context of a household, it means they are not suitable for remote deployment. However, the AudioMoth devices already mentioned can be used to record ambient sound in remote locations, including bird calls, and these sound recordings can be processed off-line by the BirdNet algorithm to provide automated call identification. Several OCSN members have the requisite expertise in python programming and the use of the TensorFlow neural network framework required for such processing.\n\n\nThe indicative budget for the initiative described here is as follows:\n\n\n\nAudioMoth device with SD cards, rechargable lithium batteries and waterproof case: 3 devices at AU$300 each = AU$900\n\n\n\n\nTitley Scientific AnaBat software license: AU$550\n\n\n\n\nBrinno TLC2020 time lapse camera with waterproof case, rechargable lithium batteries and storage card: 2 devices at AU$850 each = AU$1700\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi or Birdweather monitoring stations: subsidy for 4 additional stations (balance to be met by host, total cost of each station is AU$400-AU$500) at AU$200 per station = AU$800\n\n\n\nTotal funding sought: AU$3950"

    "title": "Birdweather PUC Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Birdweather PUC Review\nBy Alan Sheehan\nThere are a few options when it comes to electronic detection and identification of birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee also the bird call sensor network page on this web site for more information.\n\n\nThe simplest and cheapest is to download the BirdNET app to your phone. Using the app, you can record bird calls, analyse them and the app will identify the bird species (or take a wild guess if it can’t and you would like it to). That’s what the BirdNET app is good at. It’s not so good for longer term monitoring and surveys without human supervision and intervention.\nThat’s where two other solutions come into their own: the BirdNET-Pi and the Birdweather PUC.\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Churches’ BirdNET-pi station installed above his verandah in Chatham Valley\n\n\nThe BirdNET-Pi is, as the name suggests, a Raspberry Pi computer, with a microphone, running the BirdNET software. It continuously records and analyses birdcalls and can upload the data to BirdNET and Birdweather online, so adding to a global database of bird distribution and density. A BirdNET-Pi is a DIY project that can be built relatively cheaply.\nThe Birdweather PUC is a little different, in that it is a turnkey solution so it costs a bit more than building a BirdNET-Pi. At the time of writing (July, 2024) the Birdweather PUC was selling for US$249 in the USA. With exchange rates and freight, that ends up just under AU$500 here.\n\n\n\nA Birdweather PUC\n\n\nApart from bird monitoring and identification, the Birdweather PUC also records the local weather conditions (temperature, humidity and pressure), air quality index (AQI), CO2 levels, and VOCs, as well as light levels and it has GPS and accelerometers fitted to monitor motion and location.\nAt this stage, it is not clear to me how the PUC measures the AQI, CO2 and VOCs, as these are all prefaced with the letter e (i.e. eAQI, eCO2, and eVOC) denoting that they are estimated. It is not clear if the detectors in the PUC are crude and/or may lose calibration and therefore only estimate the levels, or if the mechanism for these estimates is to use the GPS location of the PUC to estimate the values based on terrestrial measurement stations. The way the sales blurb is written, it suggests the measurements are made in the PUC, but that is not clear. If you are tempted by the PUC for AQI monitoring for health purposes, I recommend doing some thorough research first. If it uses GPS position to estimate from terrestrial measurement stations, then it is probably no better than what you could achieve without it.\nOperation of the PUC is very simple (as they claim). It only has one button. Press and hold till the button turns green to turn it on. Press and hold till the button turns red to turn it off. When it’s on, double press the button (it will flash blue) to access setup mode.\nSetup mode allows the Birdweather app on your phone to detect and communicate with the PUC and set it up on your WIFI. While the PUC is in range of your WIFI, it automatically uploads detections to the web as they are made. When out of range, it stores the detections on the internal microSD card for uploading when it is back within range of the WIFI. Data is viewed on the Birdweather online app: https://app.birdweather.com/\nThe feature that attracted me to the PUC initially was the portability. It is promoted for battery operation on your backpack while hiking, so birds can be identified wherever you go. Not that I do so much bushwalking anymore these days, but we do spend a lot of time travelling, so thought it would be good to take with us.\nThe first time I set the PUC up I had it running on 3 AAA batteries. Watching the voltage from the batteries drop suggests the PUC is relatively heavy on power, and normal alkaline batteries would likely last about 8 hours / 1 day – which is OK for a day of bushwalking. Lithium batteries may last a bit longer.\nThe PUC can also be powered by USB cable, but the batteries can’t be charged this way – which is a good thing if you don’t have rechargeable batteries in it!\nI also have a 50,000 mAh powerbank with a built-in solar charging panel. Using this to power the PUC via a USB cable gave about 3 days (24 hours per day) operation in overcast conditions before it needed to be recharged.\nThe microSD card inside the PUC is 32GB capacity. At the time of writing we had been travelling for 2.5 weeks in our caravan, so had used the PUC for probably 10-12 days or so in that time and the card was about 25% full, so the microSD card should easily have capacity for a 1 month trip away from the home WIFI. That is of course dependent on the number of bird calls detected, but in two locations we stayed for over a week, the bird calls were pretty continuous.\nSo why would you choose a Birdweather PUC over a BirdNET-Pi given it’s more expensive? Well, if you are not comfortable building a Raspberry Pi computer, that could be a factor. If you want to take it with you travelling, bushwalking, etc then that may be another factor. The PUC is also weatherproof when operating on batteries (and they recommend special USB cables for weatherproof operation while powered by USB cable) so that could also be a factor when walking or doing field surveys.\nBoth the BirdNET-Pi and the Birdweather PUC are excellent solutions for continuous monitoring and identification of bird calls, and they share much of the same online technology.

    "text": "Commonly-used Sound Pressure level weightings\nOne of the challenges of infrasound assessment is that the pressure waveforms recorded by devices like the Raspberry Shake & Boom need to be converted in to Sound Pressure levels (SPL) measured on the logarithmic dB scale. There are various types of weighting used for such conversions, the most common being the db(A) weighting scale – see the chart of commonly-used SPL weightings in the margin.\nHowever, infrasound requires a quite different weighting to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear (and body, as infrasound at high levels can be felt as well as heard). This is called the G weighting scale, and looks like this:\nSoftware to carry out this weighting is not very common. However, after a bit of thought, a simple mechanism to achieve G weighting measurements has been found which does not require any high-level maths to understand. The idea is to create a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in dB(L) of the raw data, then apply the G weighting function to produce an FFT in dB(G).\nFirst I made sure the FFT in Pa was correctly normalised so it represents Pa. That is converted to dB(L), the G weighting is applied to the dB(L) to get dB(G). I’ve then converted the dB(G) back to Pa as an FFT (red plot in second axes). Now when I sum the FFTs I get a pressure in Pa which does not relate to levels in the signal unfortunately, but I am thinking the difference between these two summed pressures when convert back to dB is the difference overall between dB(L) and dB(G). It’s basically assuming the same frequency distribution across the whole sample period, which I think is the best we can hope to do without a real-time weighting circuit behind the microphone as the real SPL meters do. The estimated peak dB(G) is in the bottom right corner just above the peak dB(L). My tests show it works well in narrow band around 10Hz where dB(L) and dB(G) are the same. At this stage I can’t see any reason why there’d need to be another scaling factor in there."

In the process the code has been developed into a Python module, so it can be used by multiple programs and scripts without retyping or copying the important parts of the code.\nIn the end, the final method chosen to apply the G weighting back to the time domain signal was to apply either an octave or 1/3 octave series of filters to the signal and use the maximum linear FFT value and the corresponding value in the G weighted FFT to scale the linear waveforms to G weighting. This solution was selected after it was realised the previous average of the difference would not work with a tonal signal. A signal at a single frequency has a lot of zero frequencies in the FFT and these need to be ignored when scaling the waveforms.\nThe current state of play with output from this package is shown in the reports below. There is a lot of information included in these reports which could of course be expanded into reports of their own, such as Octave Analysis, 1/3 Octave Analysis, etc. There is probably a need to add additional functionality into the module in future for things like Leq (averaged infrasound pressure level over a time period) but for now the module only handles instantaneous infrasound pressure levels. It is not anticipated that Leq functionality will be as challenging as the G weighting and octave and 1/3 octave band analysis functionality.\n\n\n\nExample Infrasound Report with G Weighting with 1/3 Octave Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n1/3 Octave Analysis Output (linear i.e. unweighted)\n\n\n\n\n\n1/3 Octave G Analysis G Weighted output\n\n\nThe waveforms from the 1/3 octave G weighted output are added together to reconstruct a single waveform with the G weighting applied in the time domain.\nSimilarly, the “test” plot in the Infrasound Report is the result of adding the linear 1/3 octave waveforms together. As can be seen it matches the original linear waveform well. This provides confidence that the reconstructed G weighted waveform is a reasonable approximation. This is further reinforced by close agreement between the Octave (not shown) and 1/3 Octave G weighting results, so the bandwidths of 1 and 1/3 of and octave are sufficient for repeatable results.\n\nThis is very much a work in progress. Further useful discussion of the need for G weighting of infrasound SPL data can be found starting at page 59 of this slightly dated but still very useful review report."

    "title": "Wind farm visual impact assessment – part 1",
    "section": "Viewsheds",
    "text": "Viewsheds\nThe most basic type of visual impact assessment is the calculation of the viewshed of a structure. The viewshed comprises all the points in the surrounding landscape which can be seem from the top of (or any point on) a structure such as a building, tower or a wind turbine. If the the structure is a tower used for transmitting radio waves, or an obseravtion tower (such as a fire observation tower), then what can be seen from the tower by direct line-of-sight is of obvious interest.\nHowever, we are usually not very interested in what can be seen from, say, the nacelle (hub) of a wind turbine, let alone from the tips of its blades. But we are interested in which points in the landscape the blade tips, or the nacelle, or indeed the entire span of the wind turbine blades, can be seen. This is called the inverse viewshed or reverse viewshed. In fact, the viewshed and its inverse are symmetrical – if a point in the landscape can be seen from a the top of a tower, then the top of that tower can also be seen from that point in the landscape.\n\nCalculating the viewshed\nViewshed calculations rely on a digital elevation model (DEMs). These are maps of the elevation of the Earth’s surface, usually created from satellite LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensor data or related techniques. The elevation (that is, height above sea level) data they contain is typically accurate to around +/- 1m or less, and they are available for various spatial resolutions from 1 metre by 1 metre patches (pixels) up. For all the calculations here, we are using the 5 metre by 5 meter resolution DEMs provided by the NSW government, freely available from the NSW Spatial Information web portal. DEM files for Oberon and the eight regions surrounding it were downloaded and used for these blog posts. These DEMS were then stitched together to form a larger DEM, comprising the DEMS for the following regions: Wallerawang, Orange, Bathurst, Blayney, Oberon, Crookwell, Katoomba, Taralga, Burragorang.\nThe resulting DEM, viewed as a two-dimensional plot, looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless you are familiar with the geography, such 2D elevation maps can be difficult to interpret. Plotting them in 3D makes them more accessible – below is part of the Oberon-and-environs DEM visualised in three dimensions, with the proposed Palings Yard wind farm turbines shown as icons. Better icons are needed, but these icons are in the correct positions and are to-scale – that is, they accurately reflect the size of likely wind turbines in the landscape (in this case they are scaled to represent wind turbines which are 240 metres all at the top of the blade span).\nIn these animations the blue line represents the existing 500kVA transmission line (not fully shown), the whites lines are Abercrombie, Shooters Hill and Edith Rds, and the red shaded area is the exploration area for the proposed Pines wind farm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCreating these 3D animated maps will be the subject of a later blog post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine-of-sight calculations\nUsing these DEMs, a viewshed from any point on the map can be calculated by determining whether the intervening terrain will obstruct the line-of-sight from a view point to any other point on the map. The height of the view point can be specified and added to the terrain elevation at its location. Similarly, the points being viewed in the landscape can be set at a height above the terrain elevation at each point. Since we are interested in reverse viewsheds, we set the view point elevation at the relevant height of the structure of interest, such as a wind turbine, and the observation elevation at 1.5m above the terrain elevation, since that is an average eye level.\n\n\n\nA simple illustration of line-of-sight viewshed determination\n\n\nOf course, this is a simplified model because it only uses bare-earth elevations – that is, the heights of vegetation or intervening buildings are not included in the calculations. As such, the viewsheds calculated are worst-case, and trees etc may reduce the extent of actual viewsheds. However, NSW government guidelines state that bare-earth elevations should be used in visual impact assessments, precisely because they are worst-case. In fact, adding in land cover elevation information dramatically complicates the computations required, for reasons we won’t cover here. As it is, the viewshed computations potentially involve billions of calculations. Fortunately, efficient algorithms have been developed to make such computations feasible even on laptop computers, although they can still take many hours to complete.\n\n\nThe Earth is not flat…\nReality is more complicated than what is described above. Apart from trees and other ground cover, two other factors need to be taken into account when calculating viewsheds: the curvature of the Earth, and refraction of light by the atmosphere. The Earth curvature issue is intuitively obvious – if we look towards the horizon, the surface of the Earth falls away and thus the horizon is a finite distance away – in fact, on a clear day you cannot see forever! Another issue is that due to the Earth’s curvature, as we look towards the horizon (that is, approximately at a tangent to the Earth’s surface), our gaze transects increasingly higher altitudes, with thinner and thinner air. This reduction in air density creates a refraction lens effect which partially counteracts the effect of the curvature of the Earth on a viewshed, as shown in the diagram below.\n Source: Walter Bislins Advanced Earth Curvature Calculator\nThe viewshed calculation software we have used takes both of these factors into account using a simple but quite adequate correction mechanism. So let’s look at a viewshed with and without such correction."

    "text": "Viewshed shaded by distance from turbine\nAlthough a simple binary (all-or-nothing) viewshed is useful, it fails to take into account distance. Obviously, the further away you are from an object, the smaller it appears. Also, atmospheric conditions such as haze from smoke or dust (or even pollen) can reduce visibility of objects at larger distances (and fog will reduce visibility at even short distances). However, atmospheric conditions are variable and we don’t take them into account in our clculations – again, we assume a worst case of perfectly clear air. But the effcet of distance can be taken into account.\nBelow is a map of the viewshed as above (with curvature and refraction corrections enabled), but shaded by distance from the hypothetical wind turbine, to de-emphasise distant viewpoints. This is a first, small step towards better representation of visual impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewshed shaded by distance bands from turbine\nThe continuous distance shading shown above is pretty, but it may be more useful to categorise distance into bands. This is typically done in visual impact assessments.\nBelow is the same viewshed as above (with curvature and refraction corrections), but this time shaded by distance categorised into bands as suggested by James F. Palmer in the paper mentioned above – however for illustrative purposes we have extended the bands to 64.4 km (the bands suggested by Palmer stop at 32.2km, which is probably reasonable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewshed distance bands as separate layers\nFinally, we can create a variation on the map above in which each distance zone is represented as a separate layer which can be toggled on and off.

    "text": "Wikipedia defines citizen science as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizen science (also known as community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, participatory monitoring, or volunteer monitoring) is research conducted with participation from the general public, or amateur/non-professional researchers or participants for science, social science and many other disciplines. There are variations in the exact definition of citizen science, with different individuals and organisations having their own specific interpretations of what citizen science encompasses. Citizen science is used in a wide range of areas of study including ecology, biology and conservation, health and medical research, astronomy, media and communications and information science.\n\n\n\nCitizen science has been around since the 1980s, and today there are thousands of citizen science groups around the world, working on and participating in science projects and investigations ranging from collecting data on the local environment and wildlife to very ambitious projects such as CubeSats1.\n\n\nClosely related to citizen science is the concept of open science. Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks. OCSN will seek to practice open science.\n\n\n\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.2\n\n\n\nCitizen Science projects and activities\nTraditionally citizen science projects have focussed on monitoring and collecting data on the environment and local ecologies, with an emphasis on flora and fauna (plants and animals). We see such activities as key components of the OCSN program. Some examples of such activities can be found on this web site.\nHowever, we are also keen for OCSN to undertake some less usual projects, in particular projects which involve establishing a network of automated sensors for various things, which collect data continuously and make those data available through various platforms. On top of such data collection infrastructure, numerous secondary projects involving data analysis can be built. Such projects may be particularly attractive to schools. Some of proposed sensor network projects are described elsewhere on the OCSN web site.\n\n\n\nSending an OCSN CubeSat into space is probably a bit ambitious at this stage, but atmospheric science projects using drones and balloons are not out-of-the-question, such as this model CubeSat designed by AustSTEM.↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎\n\n\n\n\nAll ages\nThe intention is for OCSN to promote, facilitate and host projects and activities which appeal to all ages, including children.3 Here is a cute video by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Behind The News team on young participants in citizen science initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOCSN will adopt and enforce a suitable Working With Children Policy covering all its activities.↩︎",

    "text": "Types of Amateur Astronomy\nThere are broadly four types of amateur astronomy:\n\nNaked eye observing, involves observing the night sky with just your eyes. The only equipment needed is a reclining chair or lounge or air mattress to allow you to lie comfortably while looking up. Such observing is best done on dark nights – that is, when there is a new moon or before the moon has risen, because the brightness of the moon tends to swamp the much fainter light from the stars. It usually takes 20 or 30 minutes in total darkness before your eyes become fully dark-adapted. When they do, on a dark night at a dark sky site (of which Oberon LGA is blessed with many), the Milky Way looks absolutely breathtaking.\nVisual observing, in which participants peer through the eyepiece of a telescope to view the moon, planets, star clusters and other deep space objects (whole galaxies, nebulae etc). Large telescopes which are able to collect a lot of light are usually used for visual observing, enabling observers to see night sky objects which are much too faint to see with the naked eye, and in the case of the moon and the planets, to see details and planetary moons which are not otherwise visible. Part of the thrill of visual observing is that you are seeing the actual light from the stars and planets, in many cases light photons which have been travelling for millions of years before they hit your retina. Part of the downside is that visual observing may involve standing around outside, at night, in pitch black so your eyes remain dark-adapted, sometimes in very cold weather (and the Oberon area does get very cold at night).\nElectronically assisted astronomy (EAA), which is similar to purely visual observing, but instead of physically looking through the eyepeice of a telescope, an electronic camera is used instead, and an image is built up over several minutes. This image is typically viewed on one or more laptop or tablet computers, linked via wi-fi. The advantages are that much fainter celestial objects can be seen, because the camera and the computer it is connected to can integrate light received over several minutes (which the human eye cannot do), and also observers can sit in comfort inside out of the cold, or around a firepit, rather than shivering in the dark. Nonetheless, the observing process is still quite spontaneous, with immediate results visible for participants.\nAstrophotography, which is like EEA but typically uses smaller telescopes on very high-precision automated mounts which very precisely adjust for the rotation of the Earth. Electronic cameras are then used to capture images over many minutes or hours, sometimes over the course of many nights, and often through different filters which emphasise different wavelengths (colours) of light emitted by different elements. These images are then combined and processed using sophisticated software to create a final image, often very spectacular. The cost of the equipment needed can be quite high, and the process takes time and patience.\n\nAs you can imagine, naked-eye astronomy, visual observing through a telescope (or astronomical binoculars) and EEA can be undertaken as social activities with lots of opportunity for learning and imparting a sense of wonder, as well as knowledge, about space and the universe. Astrophotography tends to be a more solitary activity, although many astronomy clubs organise events at dark-sky sites in which a mixture of visual, EEA and astrophotography activity is undertaken by members as a social activity.",

    "text": "Introduction\nAnecdotally, rivers in the Oberon region used to be famous for their abundant platypus populations – in fact, there is a story, probably apocryphal, that the name of the Duckmaloi River, which runs through Oberon LGA, came from the surprised exclamation of Irish settlers on first encountering a platypus: “Duck-mole-oy!” (“oy” being what you said if you wanted someone to agree with you). Certainly a lot of research last century into the extent and behavious of the platypus was conducted in river systems around Oberon by researchers associated with Taronga Zoo and various NSW universities – copies of some scientific papers and reports on platypus in the Duckmaloi River, several by local resident Amanda MacLeod, can be accessed here, here and here.\nMuch less is known about the extent in the Oberon region of the rakali, also also known as the rabe, the “Australian Otter” or native water-rat, (scientific name Hydromys chrysogaster). This elusive creature lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries and feeds on aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, bird’s eggs and small water birds – and thus, it often shares similar habitats to the platypus, hence its inclusion here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABC News article on the elusive rakali\n\n\n\nA recent article published by ABC News on the rakali, and a call for citizen scientists to log sightings of it, is available here. This is something which OCSN members intend to get involved in!\n\n\n\n\nThere are several time-lapse camera videos showing the results of platypus and rakali surveillance in the upper Duckmaloi River on our Gallery page.",

    "text": "NSW BioNet Atlas records of platypus and rakali sightings or trappings in Oberon LGA\nBioNet is a database of flora and fauna information collected over many decades from multiple sources, operated by the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DPE). The role of BioNet is described by the DPE thus:\n\nBioNet aims to improve biodiversity outcomes by enabling the community and government to proactively manage and enhance biodiversity in New South Wales through comprehensive, credible and robust data and information.\n\nIt is also important because threatened and endangered species records in BioNet must be used by assessors of proposed developments in order to avoid or minimise impacts on wildlife, and is also used as part of the Biodiversity Assessment Method (BAM), which is used as part of the legislated Biodiversity Offsets Scheme (currently under review due to numerous flaws found by the Audit Office of NSW).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe data shown below were manually downloaded from the NSW government BioNet database on 24 September 2024. It is intended to convert these charts and maps to automatically update once a week with the latest data from BioNet once an API access key has been obtained.\n\n\nThe chart below shows the trend in platypus and rakali records in BioNet. These trends may reflect frequency of observations and survey efforts as much as declines or fluctuations in the animal populations or extents. This is an issue which OCSN hopes to address over the next few years by mounting regular, systematic surveys of platypus and rakali activity in key water courses in Oberon LGA, using a combination of direct observation and time-lapse camera recordings (see below). Note that there are very few observations of rakali. This may be because they are rare, but also because they are elusive – but see the video of a rakali captured by OCSN committee member Kyla Ries on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the small number of records, particularly recent records, for platypus and rakali in BioNet is a bit disappointing, and distressing. However there is a more inclusive source of biodiversity data we can query.",

OCSN can help improve this situation.\n\n\nThis recent scientific paper by Simon Roberts and Melody Serena describes the use of time-lapse cameras for detection of platypus (and presumably rakali). OCSN members have been trialling an older Brinno TLC100 camera and a current model Brinno TLC300 time-lapse cameras as described in the paper. Our findings will be described in a forthcoming blog post here on the web site.\n\n\n\nBrinno TLC300 camera ready for testing (click for larger version)\n\n\n\n\n\nBrinno TLC300 camera wrapped in camoflage purple stocking, overlooking the upper Duckmaloi River (click for larger version)\n\n\nAn example of a time-lapse platypus sighting as a result of this initial testing can be found in the gallery section of this web site.\nSeveral organisations are calling for citizen science participation in platypus (and rakali) observations and surveys. These include:\n\nthe Australian Platypus Conservancy, a long-standing NGO. Their web site contains a wealth of information on platyous biology and behaviour, survey and monitoring methods and extent information. It also include a section on rakali. Platypus sightings by citizen scientists are able to be reported thriugh their web site.\nthe platy-project a joint initiative of the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Platypus Conservation Initiative at UNSW Sydney Centre for Ecosystem Science. The platy-project also has a sighting reporting facility with excellent maps.\n\n\nSurvey methods\nExcellent information about platypus observation and systematic surveys is available from the web sites mentioned above. In particular see the platy-project toolkit and the Australian Platypus Conservancy pages on platypus surveys and monitoring and hints on spotting platypus and rakali in the wild.\nOCSN encourages its members to undertake ad hoc, opportunistic direct observation surveys as time permits, but it also intends to undertake systematic surveys of key waterways in Oberon LGA using time-lapse cameras. OCSN also intends to explore other technologies for platypus detection, including night-vision cameras using very low-level infrared (IR) illumination, as well as the use of low level ultraviolet (UV) illumination. The latter is based on the recent discovery that platypus pelts flouresce weakly in UV light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigiVol\n\n\n\nIt may be possible for Oberon Citizen Science Network to use the DigiVol crowd-sourcing platform operated by the Australian Museum to distribute the task of watching trail camera and time-lapse video to volunteers. DigiVol is an online platform which hosts “expeditions”, which are projects for which volunteers can register to under small tasks, such as watching a segment of video recorded by a wildlife or trail camera and noting if any target species appears in the footage. Each participant can undertake as few or as many of these small, discrete tasks as they wish, and as time permits, over the course of the project (expedition). OCSN will contact DigiVol to enquiry about whether they can host time-lapse camerascreening tasks for us. As well, OCSN members are encouraged to sign up as a DigiVol participant, join an expedition and undertake some tasks!\n\n\nAll sightings will be contributed to the platy-project as well as uploaded into the NSW government BioNet Atlas database, as soon as OCSN receives an account with permission to do so (an application has been submitted).\n\n\nBioCollect\nThe utility of the BioCollect app provided by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is being assessed for use in systematic platypus and rakali surveys by OCSN, in particular whether the ecoscience project type rather than the citizen science project type should be used by OCSN (note that the link on the BioCollect for ecosciences page incorrectly links to the citizen science version of the BioCollect user manual).",

    "text": "Ten Principles of Citizen Science\nOCSN seeks to adhere to and implement the ten principles of citizen science developed by researchers at a number of European and British universities, and adopted by the Australian Citizen Science Association. The formal paper describing the principles is available here, but in a nutshell they are:\n\nCitizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific endeavour that generates new knowledge or understanding. Citizens may act as contributors, collaborators, or as project leader and have a meaningful role in the project.\nCitizen science projects have a genuine science outcome. For example, answering a research question, informing conservation action, or facilitating policy decisions.\nCitizen science provides benefits to both science and society. Benefits may include learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, the publication of research outputs, contributing to scientific evidence that can influence policy on many scales (locally, nationally, and internationally), and connecting the wider community with science.\nCitizen scientists may participate in various stages of the scientific process. This may include developing research questions, designing methods, gathering and analysing data, and communicating results.\nCitizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and the research, policy or societal outcomes.\nCitizen science, as with all forms of scientific inquiry, has limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However, unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides greater opportunity for public engagement and participation, increasing accessibility of science in society.\nWhere possible and suitable, project data and meta-data from citizen science projects are made publicly available and results are published in an open access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this from occurring.\nCitizen scientists are suitably acknowledged by projects. This may include acknowledgement in project communications, result reporting and publications.\nCitizen science programs offer a range of benefits and outcomes which should be acknowledged and considered in project evaluation. Communication and evaluation of projects could include scientific outputs, data quality, participant experience and learning, knowledge sharing, social benefits, capacity building, new ways of science engagement, enhanced stakeholder dialogue, and wider societal or policy impact.\nThe leaders of citizen science projects take into consideration legal and ethical considerations of the project. These considerations include copyright, intellectual property, data sharing agreements, confidentiality, attribution, participant safety and wellbeing, traditional owner consultation, and the environmental impact of any activities.\n\n\nPresentation on the Ten Principles\nThis is a presentation in 2020 by Dr Sam Illingworth, who teaches science communication at the University of Western Australia:",

It uses advanced machine learning models to automatically identify bird species from sound recordings collected by citizen scientists around the world. Although it cannot identify every bird species from their calls (and some birds have no calls), it nonetheless has quite good coverage of Australian bird species.\nRecordings can be collected via an app running on a smartphone, using the built-in microphone or a better external microphone, or they can be collected by a small, low-power Raspberry Pi computer (not much bigger than a deck of playing cards) set up in a fixed location. Old, no longer needed smartphones installed in fixed locations can also be used.\nReady-made and packaged Birdweather PUC devices are alos available for about AU$400, as shown below. This is probably the easiest but also the most expensive way to establish a BirdNET listening station that automatically records bird calls, identifies the species of bird and uploads the data to an international citizen science database.\n\n\n\nBirdWeather PUC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY BirdNet-pi installation at the home of a OCSN member\n\n\nIt is also possible to construct your own BirdNET listening station using a Raspberry Pi computer, and external microphone and the free, open-source BirdNET software package. The steps involved are described in detail in this blog post from Core Electronics, a very good hobby electronics supplier located in Gosford, just north of Sydney. Below is a great video from Core Electronics explaining how to set up a BirdNET-Pi listening station:\n\nAs mentioned, the third option is to use a smartphone which is no longer required.\n\nBirdNET-pi local web site\nEach BirdNEtT station provides a local web site, accessible on your home wi-fi network, providing details of what species it has identified, including playback of the recordings is has made. Below are two screenshots of the local web site for the BirdNET-pi station operated by an OCSN member, and some example spectrograms of detected bird calls are shown in the margin.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi spectrogram of a magpie call\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi spectrogram of a bell miner call\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi spectrogram of a common bronzewing call\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal BirdNET-pi home page\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal BirdNET-pi statistics page\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping an Oberon LGA BirdNet network\nThe first steps for an OCSN project would be to quickly evaluate these three options at a few listening sites provided by OCSN members.\nFollowing this evaluation, a larger scale roll-out of a BirdNET sensor network in the Oberon LGA on private members’ properties and on public or state land, subject to appropriate permission, is planned. At the moment, there are two BirdNET stations in or around Oberon – there are several more in the Blue Mountains, as shown in this screencast of the global BirdNET map:",

One concern or consideration when evaluating such proposals is the effect which the wind farm construction and then the wind turbines themselves may have only the local environment and ecology. In order to assess such impacts, it is vital to record reliable, scientifically valid data on the prevalence of various bird species in areas around proposed wind farm sites. Ideally baseline data should be collected, before any construction starts, then comparable data during the construction phase and then during operation of these facilities, on an ongoing basis.\nIt appears that detailed bird species prevalence data has not been collected for the proposed wind farm site at Paling Yards, with the EIS relying on existing and very sparse ecology databases. This is a deficiency and data gap which OCSN members, in conjunction with university-based academic partners such as the QUT Ecoacoustics group, can potentially address. This is particularly important for the proper assessment of the potential environmental impact of the proposed Pines Wind Farm.",

    "text": "Air quality indicators\n\nAir Quality Index (AQI)\nAQI is an umbrella measure. It’s a good summary measure when air quality is good, but when the AQI is not so good, it gives no clue as to why it is not so good. Sometimes it may be obvious why the AQI is not good but not always.\n\n\nParticulate Matter (PM)\nParticulate Matter (or Particulates) are significant for Oberon due to industry and the associated vehicle activity, and the pollens produced by the surrounding forests and pastures. Being a colder climate Oberon also has a lot of wood-fired heaters being used for a greater portion of the year, which also adds to the exposure to particulates in the air. Unsealed roads can also be a significant source of dust (particulates) affecting those living out of town especially. Bushfires are also of course major contributors to atmospheric particulates.\n\n\nPurpleAir is one manufacturer of low-cost air quality monitoring devices.\n\n\n\nPurpleAir Flex monitoring device, seen from below showing the dual particulate sensor modules, and the accompanying smartphone app (click or tap for larger version)\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpleAir Flex monitoring device, seen from the side in its typical mounting position\n\n\nThe size of airborne particles, as well as their composition, determines their nuisance and health effects. Dust particles and fibres vary in size from coarse (non-inhalable), to fine (inhalable, sometimes call inspirable), to very fine (respirable).\nCoarse dust particles generally only reach as far as the inside of the nose, mouth or throat. Smaller or fine particles, however, can get much deeper into the sensitive regions of the respiratory tract and lungs. These smaller dust particles have a greater potential to cause serious harm to your health. Some types of extremely fine particles (see PM1.0 below) are able to cross the alveolar membranes in the lungs and directly enter the bloodstream, where they can cause general inflammation and increase clotting tendancies which are risk factors for myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes.\n\nPM10\nPM10 particulate matter is particles of 10 micrometres (µm) or less in diameter. It is of significance to Oberon as this size particle includes some types of pollens which can be produced in large quantities from the radiata pine plantations and surrounding pastures (other pollen types are 20 to 50 micrometres in size). Fly ash from the factories (if not adequately collected) and from domestic wood heaters is also in this size range as is a significant portion of sander dust (produced and burned at the factories).\n\n\nPM2.5\nPM2.5 particulates are considered one of the most harmful contaminants due to the ability for these particles to make their way deep into the lungs. Sources of PM2.5 particles include mould spores, house dust, bacteria, fly ash and incompletely combusted solid fuels like sander dust. Incomplete combustion of sander dust in the factories results in a brown plume emanating from the stacks. Bushfires are also significant but intermittent sources of these particulates.\n\n\nPM1.0\nPM1.0 are particularly fine particles which are harnful due to their ability to penetrate the lung membranes and enter the blood stream. PM1.0 particles are currently not regulated to the same extent as PM2.5 but some air quality monitors have the capability to report on PM1.0 separately to PM2.5. Smoke from any source is significant in this particle size range.\n\n\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)\nVOCs are produced from incomplete combustion, evaporation of fuels and solvents, gas leaks, and also are produced by natural processes, being emitted by plants, animals and micro-organisms.\n\n\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx)\nNOx is the collective name for nitrogen oxides commonly produced during high temperature combustion. At high temperatures atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen can combine to form these compounds, which can then react with VOCs to produce ozone (O3) or be emitted to contribute to acid rain.\n\n\nOzone (O3)\nOzone can be produced by reaction of VOCs with NOx at high temperatures or can be catalysed by UV radiation in sunlight. Ozone is an irritant and causes inflammation and may create free radicals leading to harmful oxidation in the body.\n\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)\nCarbon dioxide is a byproduct of burning carbon-containing compounds, such as wood or wood waste. The largest wood processing plant in Oberon operates a co-generation facility in which wood waste is burnt to generate electricity (along with a very large array of solar panels on the factory’s roofs). CO2 which results from this combustion is emitted via stacks some distance above the round, allowing the CO2, which is heavier than air, to disperse. However, in some conditions, particularly in still air, the emitted CO2 may sink to ground level before it has dispersed, and thus the concentration may rise in the vicinity of the source. It is very unlikely to reach dangerous levels, but changes in CO2 levels in outdoor air may be interesting to monitor.\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is produced by partial combustion of carbon-containing materials in the presence of insufficient oxygen. Usually only low levels should be emitted, but CO is very toxic, and thus monitoring for even small rises is not unreasonable.",

And of course, humans (and other animals) emit gases, particularly CO2, which can build up in poorly ventilated buildings with many people inside (eg classrooms).\nMonitoring indoor air quality is also on the OCSN agenda, to complement monitoring of outdoor air quality.",

    "text": "Motivation\nWhen a wind farm is first proposed, the almost universal reaction by people living in the affected community is “What will it look like from my home?”. Usually the formal Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and other documentation required for government assessments of wind farm development proposals include a visual impact assessment, which typically includes photorealistic simulations of the proposed wind farm from a few viewpoints selected by the developer’s consultants. However, these viewpoints are are unlikely to include views from many, or often any, private homes or properties. In addition, such visual impact assessments are usually only available when the EIS is released for public comment, which only just before the proposal is assessed by government.\nIn the case of the proposed Pines Wind Farm, the developers are offering to visit the residences and properties of interested community members to allow them to visualise the proposed Pines wind farm using augmented reality (AR) software on a tablet computer – presumably this combines simulations of the wind turbines with a photo of the view from specific viewpoints at the community member’s home or property (at the time of writing, this is unverified, but we will update this description of the Pines Wind Farm AR visualisation facility when more details are known).\nAlthough such personalised use of AR software is commendable, the capacity of the Pines Wind Farm developers to visit the homes or properties of every interested community member is obviously finite, and at this stage, technical details and documentation of the accuracy and validity of such AR visualisations have not been made available. For this reason, OCSN has prepared the visualisations provided here. These may be less sophisticated than the AR visualisations offered by the Pines Wind Farm developers, but they are accessible to anyone with access to a laptop or desktop computer, using entirely free software, and the methodology used in their preparation is open, fully documented and able to be reproduced by anyone who wishes to.",

    "text": "Getting started\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also a video…\n\n\n\nThere is also a screencast video demonstrating the steps described on this page, please see below.\n\n\nThe goal of these instructions is to get you up and running using Google Earth Pro (GEP) software to visualise the proposed Pines Wind Farm from various viewpoints of your choice, including your home or property. One big reason to use Google Earth Pro is that the software is totally free and will run on any Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac or linux computer. After completing the steps described below, you may want to explore the view from other locations, as well as other features of Google Earth Pro.\n\nStep 1: Download and install Google Earth Pro (GEP)\nSkip this step if you already have GEP installed. Please note that Google Earth is also available just via a web browser, without having to install any software, but the browser-only version cannot show the wind turbine models we have provided, so you must install GEP. To this this, open a web browser on your Windows or Mac computer and go to: https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/#earth-pro.\nSelect the “Download Earth Pro on desktop” box and then follow the instructions. This process should be straightforward – it is just like installing any other software. It will be installed where software is normally installed on your computer. There is no cost, fee or subscription needed to download, install and use Google Earth Pro software – it is entirely free.\nOnce it is installed, you can open it by double clicking on the GEP icon. GEP is a fun program, allowing you to look a places all around the world, and even visit the moon and other planets.\n\n\nStep 2: Download the Pines Wind Farm KMZ model file prepared by OCSN\nThe 3D model of the Pines Wind Farm wind turbines prepared by OCSN is called Pines_Wind_Farm_Model_Oct_2024.kmz. Click on this link to download it.\nSave it in a location that is easy for you to find on your computer – perhaps create a folder for the Pines Wind Farm Model on your desktop or in Documents and put it there. Or just leave it in the Downloads folder on your computer, which is probably where it was saved to when you clinked on the link above.\n\n\nStep 3: Open the Pines_Wind_Farm_Model_Oct_2024.kmz file in Google Earth Pro\nDouble click on the Pines_Wind_Farm_Model_Oct_2024.kmz file and it will open in GEP. Alternatively, from inside GEP you can select File then Open from the menu, and then select the Pines_Wind_Farm_Model_Oct_2024.kmz file from the folder where it is stored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf this is the first time you have used Google Earth Pro, there will be a floating window over the aerial map with tips about navigating Google Earth. It is worthwhile spending a few minutes learning how to navigate GEP by read the tips that are provided and clicking on the blue phrase, “Learn more about how to navigate Google Earth”. You can sign in if you have a Google account (e.g., you use GMail), but it is not necessary. When you are ready to move on, close the floating window by clicking the Close button (you may wish to uncheck the Show Tips at Start-up checkbox first). You can get the Start-up Tips and other instructions from the Help menu at any time. A more complete, though somewhat dated Google Earth User Guide is also available. In addition you can always search on Google for help with any questions you may have – there are lots of training videos on YouTube and other user advice available on how to make the most of GEP.\nThere are also reference notes at the end of these instructions that help you to identify GEP’s primary tools and controls. You may need to refer to those notes for more information on some of the GEP terms used here.\n\n\nIn the Places panel in upper left side of the GEP window you should see a folder named Pines Wind Farm Model - Oct 2024 that contains a list of suggested Viewpoints to get you started, as well as 8 different sets of 3D wind turbine models, which are explained in more detail below. But first, select (highlight) the Pines Wind Farm Model - Oct 2024 entry in the Places pane, choose File then Save in the menu and then select Save to My Places. You can also right-click on Pines Wind Farm Model - Oct 2024 in the Places pane and select Save to My Places – that does the same thing. Now when you start GEP next time, the Pines Wind Farm Model - Oct 2024 item will already be installed. Do not click on the KMZ file again or it will be loaded twice. To remove Pines Wind Farm Model - Oct 2024 from GEP, right-click on it and select Delete.\nClick on the greater than symbol (&gt;) to the left of Pines Wind Farm Model - Oct 2024 to see its contents:\n\nViewpoints contains some suggested viewpoints to assess the visual impact of the proposed wind farm project. Double-clicking on any of them will take you to an aerial view above that viewpoint. Of course you can choose any viewpoint you wish – these are just some suggestions to get you started.\nbelow Viewpoints you will see a list of eight different sets of models. By default, the first one, called Reference 8MW turbine - wind W should have the display box to its left already ticked. If you click on the greater than symbol to the left of that, the folder will open to reveal the individual tower models. Note the labelling/numbering of the towers is not related to any official project naming system, rather they are arbitrary labels assigned by OCSN for the purposes of building the model.\n\nNow you are ready to explore how the proposed Pines wind turbines might appear from any location in the Oberon region (and beyond).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the eight sets of 3D models\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of mid-October 2024, the Pines developers have released only limited information about the proposed layout and details of the wind farm. What we know is gleened from this press release and from this map on the Pines Wind Farm web site (static archived screenshot available here). From these we know:\n\nthe proposed locations of the “approximately 250” turbines (242 actual locations are shown on the map);\nthat the entire wind farm will have a nominal generating capacity of 2 gigawatts (2 GW or 2,000 MW);\n\nthat means that the nominal or “nameplate” capacity of each turbine will be around 8 megawatts (8 MW) (2000 MW ÷ 250 = 8 MW);\n\nas stated lsewhere on the Pines web site the turbines may be up to 300 metres tall.\n\nAll currently available 8 MW terrestrial wind turbines are well under 300 m tall at the uppermost tip of the blade arc, even when site-specific towers are used. Thus there is no single set of turbine dimensions which satisfies all the currently-known criteria (as listed above). We have therefore we have chosen to include two types of 3D model.\nThe first uses the dimensions for a reference 8 MW wind turbine published in this scientific paper – the specific dimensions are:\n\ntower height: 110 m\ntower base diameter: 7.7 m\ntower top diameter: 5 m\nnacelle dimensions: 20 m x 7.5 m x 7.5 m\nrotor diameter: 164 m\nblade root length: 2.5 m\nblade root diameter: 2 m\nblade chord at the root: 5.4 m\nblade taper to the tip: 50%\nblade twist over its length: 30°\n\nThus this turbine is 192 m high at the blade tip at the top of its arc.\nThe second 3D model uses the same dimensions for the turbine nacelle and blades but makes the tower 212.5 m tall, to give an overall height of 300 m to the blade tip at the top of its arc. The tower diameter at the base was increased using engineering principles to account for the additional stresses experienced by such a tall tower. OCSN acknowledges that such a turbine is very unlikely to be used, but it has been included to illustrate the impact on visibility of turbines which are at the maximum height allowed for the proposed Pines Wind Farm under its planning permit. It is more likely that the developers would use larger but fewer turbines if a 2 GW total wind farm capacity is retained. Currently available 12 or 14 MW turbines are between 260 m and 280 m high. However, we do not know and cannot guess where the developers might chose to locate a smaller number of larger turbines, so we have stuck to showing 242 turbines, either 192 m high or 300 m high, in the locations provided bt the Pines developers on their web site, at this stage. These models can and will be updated if and when the Pines developers release further information about the proposed turbine types and dimensions.\nFor each of these two 3D turbine models, we have provided four different sets of turbines models. Horizontal-axis wind turbines use a yaw motor to rotate them to face the wind, and thus they may differ in appearance when viewed from any given location depending on the wind direction. To model this, we have given each of the 242 turbines a normally-distributed random orientation with a mean heading of a prevailing wind direction: West (W), South-west (SW), North-west (NW) or East (E).\nTo see the effect of the different turbine heights, and/or different prevailing wind directions, you can select which of the sets of model is visible in the Places pane on the left. Generally you should only look at one of the eight provided model sets at one time, but you can look at several or all of them if you wish (but that will be in no way realistic, of course).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: View from your home or property\nWe will start by seeing if the proposed wind turbines will be visible from your home. In the Search panel of the side Bar in the top left of the GEP window, type your home address and click Search. This will create a Placemark on the map and bring you to an aerial view of the address at an elevation a bit over 1000 m above the ground. Next we need to get down to a ground-level view.\nTake the mouse cursor to the upper right side of the window and click-and-hold on the orange Pegman symbol. If the street in front or near your house turns blue, drag and drop Pegman’s feet to where you want the viewpoint to be. Viola! You are in Street View and you are looking at actual photographs taken by a Google StreetView vehicle at some stage. At the bottom of the window is the date of the photograph, its latitude and longitude and elevation (ignore “eye alt”). The eye-level of all Street View photos is approximately 3 m, which is a bit higher than normal eye-level. Of course, no Pines Wind Farm turbines are visible in these actual Street View photographs, since they do not exist, they are only proposed at this stage.\n\n\nThere are alternate ways to get to Ground View mode. You could simply click near the Placemark; keep clicking but not too fast, until you are at Ground View. Or you could hold the cursor/crosshairs over the location you want for a viewpoint and use the mouse scroll-wheel to get down to ground-level.\nTo see the 3D models of the wind turbines, you need to change to Terrain View by clicking on the building icon at the top of the Navigation Tools which is at the upper-right of the GEP window when you are in Street View mode. Use the circular Look Around tool’s left or right arrows to pan around the view while staying in place. (Do not use the up and down arrows or the Move Around tool yet.) Do you see any turbines? If you do, pan until the largest turbine is in the centre of the screen where it will then be in the proper scale (provided you have not used the Zoom tool to enlarge it).\nIf you do not see turbines, finish reading the instructions for this step and then go to the next step.\nNote that if Street View photographs are not available for your address or property, the steps above will still work – you can still drag the little orange Pegman to your desired viewpoint – but it will immediately enter Terrain View mode (in which the turbine models are displayed if they are visible from that viewpoint location).\nExpand the window to full screen size. Notice that the view stays the same – it is just larger. The view always defaults to approximately a 90 ° angle of view in both Terrain View and Street View. The appropriate viewing distance for this view is half of its width – that is, you should position your eyes half a screen width away from the screen. If you are viewing on a laptop computer, that means positioning your eye about 15 cm away from the screen, which is really close – if you suffer from age-related presbyopia (most people over the age of 50 years or so do) then you may not be able to focus on the screen. However, if your eyes are half the screen width away from the screen, the turbines will be appropriately scaled as you would see them if they actually existed. Do not use the Zoom Tool because it changes the angle of view and then the appropriate viewing distance will be unknown. If you do move the zoom slider, you can reset to default zoom for correct visual assessment by exiting the ground-level view using the Exit ground-level view button at the upper right of the GEP window, and then returning the ground-level view again.\n\n\nOne solution to having to view the screen at a distance of half its width, in order to get the correct view of the simulated turbines, is to use a bigger screen. Most flat panel TVs have additional HDMI inout ports on their back or side. If your laptop has an HDMI outport socket, you can use an HDMI cable to connect your laptop to your TV, and display Google Earth Pro in full-screen mode on the TV. If your TV screen is, say, 1.2 m wide, then if you sit in front of the TV about 60 cm away from it, you will have the correct view of the simulated turbines (remember, don’t use the Zoom tool!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese recommendations for the screen viewing distance and use of the default zoom level were provided by Professor James Palmer, who found that viewing the screen at a distance of half the screen width, at the default zoom level in Terrain View, provides a view which is equivalent to a 60mm focal length on a 35mm camera. Most visual impact assessment guidelines call for the use of a 50mm focal length lens on a 35mm camera (or equivalent), so this is quite close to that. In fact, Professor Palmer found in other work that a slightly longer focal length of about 80mm gives better perceptual validity for such visual impact assessments. OCSN urges you to view the simulated wind turbines using these recommendations, ideally on a large flat-panel TV screen so your eyes can be 60cm or so away from the screen.\n\n\nIf Street View photographs are available at your chosen viewpoint, you can move the mouse cursor to the upper right corner of the screen and switch back to Street View by clicking on the blueish Pegman icon. Check that the horizon in Street View matches the horizon in Terrain View by switching back and forth. As you switch back and forth, note whether the vegetation and buildings in Street View would screen any turbines visible in Terrain View.\nWhile not perfect, this gives you a good sense of whether the turbines will be visible from this particular viewpoint. If Street View is not available at a viewpoint location, then it is not possible to assess whether nearby trees or buildings will screen off sight of the turbines. If any trees are in the distance, this deficiency will make little difference, because the wind turbines tower over all trees, but it does make a difference if there are nearby trees between your viewpoint and the turbines. One way of checking this is to take some static snapshots in GEP (details below), transfer them to your smartphone of a tablet computer, and take them outside to the actual viewpoint to see if nearby trees or buildings obscure the turbines.\n\n\nStep 5: Moving around to see turbines\nThe next question is how extensive are views of the turbine in your neighbourhood. Use the Look Around tool to face a direction you want to move – or click-and-hold and swipe sideways to rotate the view. Move forward in Street View or Terrain View by clicking on the forward or backward arrows, or to move forward faster, double-click on a location further down the road. Be patient – using mouse clicks to navigate can be finnicky. If double-clicking does not work, use the mouse scroll-wheel.\nIn Terrain View you can move off the road (but there likely will not be corresponding Street View photos off the road). Rotate the view to the direction you want to go (the Look Around tool will show where north is relative to the direction you are facing). Then move straight forward using the scroll-wheel, or double-click on a location you want to move toward.\nIf you stay on a road for which Street View photos are available, switching back and forth between the Terrain View and Street View gives you some idea of how often the turbines will be screened or not by nearby trees and buildings.\n\n\nStep 6: View settings to improve the visual contrast\nSometimes it may be difficult to see the turbines with GEP’s default settings, which do not include the variable effects of sun lighting. GEP can simulate sunlight for a specific time of day (and the night sky after sunset). When the turbines are front lit they will appear lighter, when they are backlit they will be darker. In the Tool Bar at the top of the GEP window click on the Show Sunlight icon of the rising sun. It brings up a slider that controls the sun’s angle for the time of day.\nAnother adjustment changes the sky to be lighter and more vibrant. In Windows, open the GEP Options in the Tools menu (on an Apple Mac, open Preferences in the Google Earth Pro menu) and check Photorealistic Atmosphere Rendering in the 3D View tab.\n\n\nStep 7: Examine different turbine heights and wind directions\nAs noted in the About the eight sets of 3D models call-out box above, we have provided eights sets of 3D turbine models – two different turbine heights for each of four prevailing wind directions. To see the effect of the different turbine heights, and/or different prevailing wind directions, you can select which of the sets of model is visible in the Places pane on the left. Generally you should only look at one of the eight provided model sets at one time, but you can look at several or all of them if you wish (but that will be in no way realistic, of course).\n\n\nStep 8: Saving a viewpoint\nIf you have found a view that you want to save so you can come back to it, you can do that in Terrain View. First use the Look Around tool to put the most prominent turbine in the centre of the image and the horizon in the middle of the image. Then click on the Add Placemark tool (it looks like a yellow pushpin) in the Tool Bar. This brings up a window: type in the viewpoint name, and make sure that the Altitude is set to Clamped to Ground. Then click OK. It should be saved under My Places in the Places panel, though it may be somewhere else in the Places panel.\nNow you can always get back to that view. Click the Exit ground-level view button in the upper right corner of the window (if it is not visible, just move around the view a bit). The Placemark will become visible from an elevated view. Either double-click on the Placemark in My Places, or double-click at the base of the Placemark to retrieve the view.\nYou can also save a view as a static .jpg file which you can email, share on social media and so on. In the File menu, select Save, then Save Image. Select Map Options to control the information displayed with the view. Click in the Untitled Map box to title the image. In the upper left corner is the Legend, and you can turn features that may be in the view on or off. Adjust the image resolution – the higher the better, though it means a larger file. Then click Save Image.\n\n\nStep 9: Visit the provided viewpoints\nYou may also wish to explore the views of the proposed wind farm from the viewpoints provided. Visiting the Prison Farm is worthwhile – it is right amongst and quite close to several of the proposed turbines.",

    "text": "Technical details\nThe proposed locations of the Pines Wind Farm wind turbines were digitised manually using the information provied in the map on the Pines Wind farm web site home page (links given above). As such, there may be minor errors in the assigned positions for each of the proposed turbines, but these errors are unlikely to be greater than 10 or 20 metres. OCSN did contact the Pines Wind farm developers to request a digital file of the proposed turbine coordinates but did not receive the benefit of a reply. Our version of the proposed turbine coordinates are available in this KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file.\nWe then extracted transformed coordinate data from this KML file using the following R code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nsf::read_sf(\"assets/Pines_Windfarm_Tower_Locations_Oct_2024.kml\") |&gt;\n  mutate(lon = sf::st_coordinates(geometry)[,1],\n         lat = sf::st_coordinates(geometry)[,2]) |&gt;\n  write_csv(\"assets/pines_turbines_oct_2024_lat_long.csv\")\n\nThe resulting CSV file of coordinates is avilable here.\nWe then used the Python package collada_wt available at this GitHub repository (the package is also installable via pip) to create 3D Collada format wind turbine models for use in Google Earth Pro. The simplekml package for Python (installable using pip) was used to add the 3D models at each of the 242 proposed turbine locations to a KML file. As described in the About the eight sets of 3D models call-out box above, eight sets of models were created. A normally-distributed random variable was used to set the heading for each tower.

    "text": "Current status of this initiative\n\n\n\nThis page is currently a place holder for some more concrete plans to establish an automated or semi-automated eco-acoustic monitoring network in key parts of Oberon SLA. More details to follow in due course.\nInspired by the capabilities of the Birdweather PUC and BirdNET-pi bird call monitoring stations, which are small computing devices which use machine learning (a limited form of artificial intelligence) to automatically detect and classify bird calls from audio they automatically record from attached microphones, OCSN plans to investigate the more general utility of eco-acoustics for ecological and biodiversity surveys in the Oberon region.\nOne of the problems with the Birdweather PUC and BirdNet-pi devices is that they require quite a lot of power to run (relatively speaking, in fact they use only a few watts, about as much as a small LED light bulb, which is very little when mains power is available, but quite a lot if it has to be supplied by batteries for any length of time). This makes them more suited to deployment near buildings which can supply 5 volt power to them continuously from a small mains-powered power supply unit (or via power-over-ethernet if they are connected via a network cable). The relatively high power requirement is due to the fact that the devices are doing edge computing, that is they are continuously evaluating (running) the machine learning models they use, and this requires quite a lot of computing power and hence electrical power.",
