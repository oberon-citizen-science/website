Details of these proposed projects are provided below. It is the intention of OCSN to contribute to the debate around these projects and to help inform decision-making processes (such as by responding to calls for comments on project Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)), through projects designed to collect and analyse scientific data of relevance.

This development has been enabled by recent changes to the relevant NSW legislation pertaining to Forestry Corporation management of state forests, permitting up to 7% of state forest land areas to be used for renewable energy projects. The developers of the proposed Pines Wind Farm are TAG Energy and Stromlo Energy.\nThe interactive map below shows the exploration area granted to the developers by Forestry Corporation NSW for possible location of the proposed wind farm in (largely) state forest areas. The exploration area is shaded in red, and the existing 500 kVA transmission line to Taralga to which the wind farm must connect shown as a blue line.\nBetter maps and more details will appear here in the future (see also below for work-in-progress on more sosphicated geospatial visualistions).",

    "text": "OCSN plans which may help inform wind farm decision making processes\nFollowing is a list of potential activities in which OCSN may engage to help inform debate and decision making around wind farm developments. Not all these activities may proceed, it depends on the support for their undertaking by potential OCSN members, and in some cases, on the success of OCSN in obtaining government, philanthropic or other funding to support these initiatives. Collaboration with scientists with particular areas of expertise in universities and research institutes will also be required, and OCSN will approach suitable research groups regarding such collaboration in due course.\n\nApart from funding from government grant schemes and philanthropic donors, OCSN intends to seek financial contributions from the wind farm developers themselves, to support projects such as deployment of a network of Raspberry Shake & Boom seismic and infrasound monitoring stations in and around the proposed wind farm development areas. We believe that such funding would represent a show of good will and openness on the part of the proposed wind farm developers. However, funding will not be accepted if there are conditions on publication of the results of OCSN investigations, and if all data collected cannot be made openly and publicly available. As a principle, all OCSN funding sources will be clearly listed on this web site – OCSN is committed to openness and transparency.\n\n\nReview of the adequacy of scientific data and engineering considerations in the Paling Yards EIS submission, in anticipation of an opportunity for further public input into the decision making processes around this proposed development.\nAssemble a set of informational resources around the science and engineering aspects of wind farm construction and operation.\nFurther investigation of the capabilities of Raspberry Shake & Boom devices to detect and monitor infrasound generated by wind turbines and other sources. This may involve establishing some positive control monitoring sites near existing wind turbines of the same (or smaller) scale as those proposed for Oberon LGA. The possibility of testing monitoring capability for infrasound generated by the two small, first-generation wind turbines which are visible from Jenolan caves Road at Hampden will be investigated, if a suitable host site can be found. See also this blog post for a description of work-in-progress on infrasound monitoring.\nRoll out of an expanded Raspberry Shake & Boom (RS&B) device network across Oberon LGA, but with particular emphasis on the areas in and adjacent to the proposed wind farm developments, to monitor baseline and (if the proposals proceed) operational infrasound. The RS&B devices are sensitive enough to detect blasting, rock excavation and even heavy truck movements nearby, which may also be useful during construction phases.\nDetailed mapping and photographic documentation of the remnant native forest areas in the Pines Wind farm exploration area (see map above). Although the Gurnang and Vulcan state forests are predominantly pine plantations, they nevertheless still contain or are bordered by native high country forest cover, particularly along waterways. This native vegetation areas are likely to provide both refuge and transit corridors for native flora and fauna, and thus need to be carefully assessed and be given due consideration when assessing wind farm development proposals. This mapping work may be able to be done as a desktop exercise using high-resolution aerial photograph databases, but on-the-ground validation by OCSN working parties is likely to be needed too.\nUndertaking systematic frog population surveys along waterways and water bodies in and around the proposed wind farm areas, in collaboration with the FrogID research team led by Dr Jodi Rowley at the Australian Museum in Sydney. The feasibility of developing automated monitoring devices for key target species will also be examined.\nEstablish a BirdNET monitoring network in Oberon LGA, with particular emphasis in and around the proposed wind farm development areas.\n\nBirdNET appears to be a good solution for monitoring populations of many types of birds, but it is not suitable for monitoring birds-of-prey, which are potentially vulnerable to being affected by wind turbines, since they may occupy the same air space as the spinning turbine blades. Thus, OCSN will seek to evaluate the potential for automated birds-of-prey monitoring as described in this intriguing scientific paper (and/or similar ideas).\n\nStream and water body water quality monitoring. Because they include some of the highest altitudes in the NSW Central Tablelands, the proposed wind farm areas encompass the headwaters of several creeks and waterways which form or flow into some of the high country rivers whicvh run through Oberon LGA. These headwaters are themselves likely to be ecologically significant, but they also affect the ecology of downstream rivers such as the Duckmaloi, which is known to be one of the very few high country refuges for our nationally-dwindling platypus population. Thus, OCSN will seek to implement water quality monitoring in key waterways likely to be affected by wind farm development, given that the proposed wind farms represent large-scale construction projects involving significant road building and widening, deep foundation excavation and other earthworks which may impact the local riparian environments in ways which timber logging does not. This monitoring may involve periodic water sample collection and analysis, or could involve automated continuous remote monitoring of metrics such as water turbidity.\nProvide an open, freely-accessible zone of visual influence analysis facility for the proposed wind farms. the zone of visual influence, sometimes called a inverse viewshed, is the geographic area from which a development or other structure is theoretically visible, at various sizes. Stromlo Energy, one of the developers of the proposed Pines Wind Farm, has indicated that it plans to provide such a facility to the community through individual consultations. That is fine, but the ability to assess visual impact independent of the wind farm developers is also important, and it is also a potentially interesting and educational community project involving geography, geometry and information technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial visualisation Work-in-progress\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are two brief animations of 3D geospatial modelling of the southern part of Oberon LGA. The map is created from the 5 metre by 5 metre LiDAR digital elevation grid of NSW, aggregated to a 10m by 10m grid. Overlaid on that are the exploration area for the proposed Pines wind farm, shown in red shading, the existing 500 kVA transmission line to Taralga in blue (ignore that it cuts off to the south, that will be fixed), and the white lines are Abercrombie, Shooters Hill and Edith Roads (also truncated to the south). The red lollipos to the south are representations of the 6MW wind turbines for the proposed Paling Yards wind farm, to scale (240m rotor tip height, 160m rotor diameter). We are working on a better icon for the turbines! A great deal more can be done regarding geospatial visualisation using available data sources, and not just regarding proposed wind farms, of course.\nIf you are interested in assisting with this work, or learning how to do it, please get in touch using the email link in the menu above and at left. We only use free, open-source software for this work so anyone with a reasonable laptop computer can participate and replicate it.\nYou might want to view these in full screen mode – if so, click the square with a circle in it at the bottom right of the video window.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe welcome other ideas! Please register your expression of interest if you would like to be involved in any of these potential projects.\nHere is an animated example of",

    "text": "BirdNET\nAnother potential project for OCSN is the establishment of a BirdNET bird call monitoring network to collect data on the prevalence of various bird species in the Oberon LGA.\nBirdNET is a citizen science initiative developed at US Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology and at Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany. It uses advanced machine learning models to automatically identify bird species from sound recordings collected by citizen scientists around the world. Although it cannot identify every bird species from their calls (and some birds have no calls), it nonetheless has quite good coverage of Australian bird species.\nRecordings can be collected via an app running on a smartphone, using the built-in microphone or a better external microphone, or they can be collected by a small, low-power Raspberry Pi computer (not much bigger than a deck of playing cards) set up in a fixed location. Old, no longer needed smartphones installed in fixed locations can also be used.\nReady-made and packaged Birdweather PUC devices are alos available for about AU$400, as shown below. This is probably the easiest but also the most expensive way to establish a BirdNET listening station that automatically records bird calls, identifies the species of bird and uploads the data to an international citizen science database.\n\n\n\nBirdWeather PUC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY BirdNet-pi installation at the home of a OCSN member\n\n\nIt is also possible to construct your own BirdNET listening station using a Raspberry Pi computer, and external microphone and the free, open-source BirdNET software package. The steps involved are described in detail in this blog post from Core Electronics, a very good hobby electronics supplier located in Gosford, just north of Sydney. Below is a great video from Core Electronics explaining how to set up a BirdNET-Pi listening station:\n\nAs mentioned, the third option is to use a smartphone which is no longer required.\n\nBirdNET-pi local web site\nEach BirdNEtT station provides a local web site, accessible on your home wi-fi network, providing details of what species it has identified, including playback of the recordings is has made. Below are two screenshots of the local web site for the BirdNET-pi station operated by an OCSN member, and some example spectrograms of detected bird calls are shown in the margin.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi spectrogram of a magpie call\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi spectrogram of a bell miner call\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdNET-pi spectrogram of a common bronzewing call\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal BirdNET-pi home page\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal BirdNET-pi statistics page\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping an Oberon LGA BirdNet network\nThe first steps for an OCSN project would be to quickly evaluate these three options at a few listening sites provided by OCSN members.\nFollowing this evaluation, a larger scale roll-out of a BirdNET sensor network in the Oberon LGA on private members’ properties and on public or state land, subject to appropriate permission, is planned. At the moment, there are two BirdNET stations in or around Oberon – there are several more in the Blue Mountains, as shown in this screencast of the global BirdNET map:",

One concern or consideration when evaluating such proposals is the effect which the wind farm construction and then the wind turbines themselves may have only the local environment and ecology. In order to assess such impacts, it is vital to record reliable, scientifically valid data on the prevalence of various bird species in areas around proposed wind farm sites. Ideally baseline data should be collected, before any construction starts, then comparable data during the construction phase and then during operation of these facilities, on an ongoing basis.\nIt appears that detailed bird species prevalence data has not been collected for the proposed wind farm site at Paling Yards, with the EIS relying on existing and very sparse ecology databases. This is a deficiency and data gap which OCSN members, in conjunction with university-based academic partners such as the QUT Ecoacoustics group, can potentially address.

The formal paper describing the principles is available here, but in a nutshell they are:\n\nCitizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific endeavour that generates new knowledge or understanding. Citizens may act as contributors, collaborators, or as project leader and have a meaningful role in the project.\nCitizen science projects have a genuine science outcome. For example, answering a research question, informing conservation action, or facilitating policy decisions.\nCitizen science provides benefits to both science and society. Benefits may include learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, the publication of research outputs, contributing to scientific evidence that can influence policy on many scales (locally, nationally, and internationally), and connecting the wider community with science.\nCitizen scientists may participate in various stages of the scientific process. This may include developing research questions, designing methods, gathering and analysing data, and communicating results.\nCitizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and the research, policy or societal outcomes.\nCitizen science, as with all forms of scientific inquiry, has limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However, unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides greater opportunity for public engagement and participation, increasing accessibility of science in society.\nWhere possible and suitable, project data and meta-data from citizen science projects are made publicly available and results are published in an open access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this from occurring.\nCitizen scientists are suitably acknowledged by projects. This may include acknowledgement in project communications, result reporting and publications.\nCitizen science programs offer a range of benefits and outcomes which should be acknowledged and considered in project evaluation. Communication and evaluation of projects could include scientific outputs, data quality, participant experience and learning, knowledge sharing, social benefits, capacity building, new ways of science engagement, enhanced stakeholder dialogue, and wider societal or policy impact.\nThe leaders of citizen science projects take into consideration legal and ethical considerations of the project. These considerations include copyright, intellectual property, data sharing agreements, confidentiality, attribution, participant safety and wellbeing, traditional owner consultation, and the environmental impact of any activities.\n\n\nPresentation on the Ten Principles\nThis is a presentation in 2020 by Dr Sam Illingworth, who teaches science communication at the University of Western Australia:",

Please read on for more information!\nOCSN is a newly formed collective of people living in and around the Oberon local government area (LGA) in the Central Tablelands of NSW who are interested in science and in participating in scientific investigation of interesting and/or important aspects of our environment. By science we mean STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities in general. These include biology and ecology, and the impacts of human activity on those domains, as well as earth science, astronomy and any other safe and non-harmful scientific investigations members may wish to pursue. Projects involving technology and engineering are also in-scope for OCSN, particularly projects involving development of sensor and other methods to study the world around us. Creating peer-reviewed summaries of current scientific findings is also in scope, to help provide reliable and unbiased sources of information about STEM matters which are important to the local community. A list of current and potential activities and projects can be found in the list on the left. This list may expand or contract depending on the interests of OCSN participants.\nParticipants in OCSN do not need to be trained scientists, engineers, technologists or mathematicians – just having an interest in science (or more broadly, STEM) and an allegiance to the scientific method (which is embodied in the OCSN Mission Statement and OCSN Articles of Association for the organisation) is enough. All projects and activities undertaken or promoted by OCSN will include trained scientists and engineers, acting in a voluntary capacity or, in some cases, in academic roles affiliated with universities and research institutes. The idea is to promote and transmit an appreciation of STEM subjects and the scientific method to both OCSN participants and the wider community.\nWith that out of the way, please do read on using the link below or the links at the left to learn more about OCSN and its aims and potential activities.",

There are variations in the exact definition of citizen science, with different individuals and organisations having their own specific interpretations of what citizen science encompasses. Citizen science is used in a wide range of areas of study including ecology, biology and conservation, health and medical research, astronomy, media and communications and information science.\n\n\n\nCitizen science has been around since the 1980s, and today there are thousands of citizen science groups around the world, working on and participating in science projects and investigations ranging from collecting data on the local environment and wildlife to very ambitious projects such as CubeSats1.\n\n\nClosely related to citizen science is the concept of open science. Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks. OCSN will seek to practice open science.\n\n\n\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.2\n\n\n\nCitizen Science projects and activities\nTraditionally citizen science projects have focussed on monitoring and collecting data on the environment and local ecologies, with an emphasis on flora and fauna (plants and animals). We see such activities as key components of the OCSN program. Some examples of such activities can be found on this web site.\nHowever, we are also keen for OCSN to undertake some less usual projects, in particular projects which involve establishing a network of automated sensors for various things, which collect data continuously and make those data available through various platforms. On top of such data collection infrastructure, numerous secondary projects involving data analysis can be built. Such projects may be particularly attractive to schools. Some of proposed sensor network projects are described elsewhere on the OCSN web site.\n\n\n\nSending an OCSN CubeSat into space is probably a bit ambitious at this stage, but atmospheric science projects using drones and balloons are not out-of-the-question, such as this model CubeSat designed by AustSTEM.↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎\n\n\n\n\nAll ages\nThe intention is for OCSN to promote, facilitate and host projects and activities which appeal to all ages, including children.3 Here is a cute video by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Behind The News team on young participants in citizen science initiatives.\n\n\n\n\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.4\n\n\n\n\nOCSN will adopt and enforce a suitable Working With Children Policy covering all its activities.↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎",

Using devices developed over several years by the international Raspberry Shake (see the Raspberry Shake web site for details), based on the tiny but very powerful Raspberry Pi single baord computer which is about the size of a deck of playing cards, it is now feasible for citizens scientists to host their own seismic monitoring stations and contribute the data they collect to a worldwide community of people interested in such data. More recently, the ability to also monitor and record infrasound (very low frequency sound waves, mostly below the frequencies which humans can hear) has been added to these devices, allowing the deep rumbles caused by earthquakes to be detected, as well as other sources of infrasound, incuding aircraft, wind blowing through forests, wind turbines and sonic booms from meteorites entering the earth’s atmosphere. Please see the page on meteorite tracking for more information on this.",

    "text": "Raspberry Shake and Boom capabilities\n\nDetecting distant earthquakes\nYou don’t need special skills to use a Raspberry Shake and Boom (RS&B for short) – the example below is from the very nice ShakeNet phone app provided by the Raspberry Shake community. It lists earthquakes happening world-wide so you can see if your RS&B station detected them or not. As you can see, an RS&B station in Oberon LGA can readily detect earthquakes thousands of kilometres away.\n\n\n\nRecording of a recent earthquake near Tonga in the Pacific Ocean, as recorded by the Raspberry Shake & Boom monitoring station operated by Alan Sheehan just south of Oberon township\n\n\n\n\nDetecting local earthquakes\nOf course, the devices can also detect , less intense local earthquakes, as shown below.\n\n\n\nRecording of the earthquake south of Leura on 8 March 2024, as captured near Oberon by Alan Sheehan using a Raspberry Shake & Boom device\n\n\n\n\nMeteorite and space debris sonic booms\nMeteorites and space debris enter the Earth’s atmospshere at supersonic speeds, creating sonic booms from the resulting shock wave. On the morning of August 9, 2022 at 7:05am the SpaceX Crew 1 Dragon Trunk re-entered the atmosphere over Western NSW, the Snowy Mountains and eastern Victoria. This is the infrasound signal of that event captured on a Raspberry Shake and Boom operated by Alan Sheehan just outside Oberon, some 370kms away from the point of closest approach.\n\n\n\nSpaceX trunk re-entry infrasound signal 2022\n\n\n\n\nDIY data analysis\nWith a little program code, using the Python programming language, you can fully explore the capabilities of your Raspberry Shake and Boom. Don’t worry - we are happy to share code and help you to learn how to do it. Shown below is a custom analysis of an earthquake in Honshu, Japan, programmed by Alan Sheehan.\n\n\n\nCustom analysis of Honshu earthquake programmed by Alan Sheehan\n\n\n\n\nInfrasound\nBelow is the infrasound signal of a passing helicopter, showing the Doppler shift in frequencies as it first approaches then receeds from the monitoring Raspeberry Shake and Boom device. You don’t need any coding skill for this type of report either - its available from the Raspberry Shake Data View web app and you can join and use any or all the Raspberry Shakes in the world for free (you don’t even have to own one!), via the ShakeNet web site.\n\n\n\nHelicopter infrasound\n\n\n\n\nWind turbine infrasound\n\n\nIt should be born in mind that merely detecting infrasound generated by wind turbines does not necessarily imply that that infrasound has impacts on human (and/or non-human) health, or even that humans and other animals can detect it. Nonetheless, we beleive that it is important to develop capabilities to monitor such artifical sources of infrasound, as well as natural sources such as wind blowing through trees and sound generated by fast flowing water in river rapids, and to collect baseline data before any proposed wind turbines are constructed, as well as after they become operational. OCSN also intends to undertake a meta-review of articles and reports which review and summarise the scientific evidence around the effect of infrasound on human health and the broader ecology.\nThe infrasound microphone in the Raspberry Shake and Boom device should be able to detect infrasound generated by wind turbines. Not much work has been done yet to fully investigate and validate these capabilities, and further investigation of this will be one of the initial projects to be undertaken by OCSN. However, if the infrasound data from a Raspberry Shake and Boom deployed at Koroit, which is near Warrnambool in Victoria and close to several large wind farms, is processed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), some interesting features become evident in the resulting spectrograms. We suspect the spikes in the FFT spectrums shown below are tonal frequencies from laminar boundary layer, blunt trailing edges and/or flow over holes, slits and intrusions in nearby wind towers. It shows the potential capability of the RSnB to continuously monitor infrasound generated by wind turbines at a range of distances, although this very preliminary work still needs to be carefully validated.",

For example, there is a proposed development of a large wind turbine farm at Paling Yards, which is in the catchment area of the Abercrombie River. There has been little or no consideration of the effect of wind farm development on the Booroolong frog in the Paling Yards development EIS (environmental impact statement). In fact, the Biodiversity Development Assessment Report for the Paling Yards Wind Farm notes on page 44 that no Booroolong frogs were recorded within 10km of the proposed development area, which appears to be at odds with data collected by the FrogID project. There is clearly a role for local OCSN citizen scientists, working in collaboration with FrogID scientists, to check these facts.\nThere are also many other vulnerable or threatened species listed in the Biodiversity Assessment Report for Paling Yards, including many bird species.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Birdweather PUC Review\nBy Alan Sheehan\nThere are a few options when it comes to electronic detection and identification of birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee also the bird call sensor network page on this web site for more information.\n\n\nThe simplest and cheapest is to download the BirdNET app to your phone. Using the app, you can record bird calls, analyse them and the app will identify the bird species (or take a wild guess if it can’t and you would like it to). That’s what the BirdNET app is good at. It’s not so good for longer term monitoring and surveys without human supervision and intervention.\nThat’s where two other solutions come into their own: the BirdNET-Pi and the Birdweather PUC.\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Churches’ BirdNET-pi station installed above his verandah in Chatham Valley\n\n\nThe BirdNET-Pi is, as the name suggests, a Raspberry Pi computer, with a microphone, running the BirdNET software. It continuously records and analyses birdcalls and can upload the data to BirdNET and Birdweather online, so adding to a global database of bird distribution and density. A BirdNET-Pi is a DIY project that can be built relatively cheaply.\nThe Birdweather PUC is a little different, in that it is a turnkey solution so it costs a bit more than building a BirdNET-Pi. At the time of writing (July, 2024) the Birdweather PUC was selling for US$249 in the USA. With exchange rates and freight, that ends up just under AU$500 here.\n\n\n\nA Birdweather PUC\n\n\nApart from bird monitoring and identification, the Birdweather PUC also records the local weather conditions (temperature, humidity and pressure), air quality index (AQI), CO2 levels, and VOCs, as well as light levels and it has GPS and accelerometers fitted to monitor motion and location.\nAt this stage, it is not clear to me how the PUC measures the AQI, CO2 and VOCs, as these are all prefaced with the letter e (i.e. eAQI, eCO2, and eVOC) denoting that they are estimated. It is not clear if the detectors in the PUC are crude and/or may lose calibration and therefore only estimate the levels, or if the mechanism for these estimates is to use the GPS location of the PUC to estimate the values based on terrestrial measurement stations. The way the sales blurb is written, it suggests the measurements are made in the PUC, but that is not clear. If you are tempted by the PUC for AQI monitoring for health purposes, I recommend doing some thorough research first. If it uses GPS position to estimate from terrestrial measurement stations, then it is probably no better than what you could achieve without it.\nOperation of the PUC is very simple (as they claim). It only has one button. Press and hold till the button turns green to turn it on. Press and hold till the button turns red to turn it off. When it’s on, double press the button (it will flash blue) to access setup mode.\nSetup mode allows the Birdweather app on your phone to detect and communicate with the PUC and set it up on your WIFI. While the PUC is in range of your WIFI, it automatically uploads detections to the web as they are made. When out of range, it stores the detections on the internal microSD card for uploading when it is back within range of the WIFI. Data is viewed on the Birdweather online app: https://app.birdweather.com/\nThe feature that attracted me to the PUC initially was the portability. It is promoted for battery operation on your backpack while hiking, so birds can be identified wherever you go. Not that I do so much bushwalking anymore these days, but we do spend a lot of time travelling, so thought it would be good to take with us.\nThe first time I set the PUC up I had it running on 3 AAA batteries. Watching the voltage from the batteries drop suggests the PUC is relatively heavy on power, and normal alkaline batteries would likely last about 8 hours / 1 day – which is OK for a day of bushwalking. Lithium batteries may last a bit longer.\nThe PUC can also be powered by USB cable, but the batteries can’t be charged this way – which is a good thing if you don’t have rechargeable batteries in it!\nI also have a 50,000 mAh powerbank with a built-in solar charging panel. Using this to power the PUC via a USB cable gave about 3 days (24 hours per day) operation in overcast conditions before it needed to be recharged.\nThe microSD card inside the PUC is 32GB capacity. At the time of writing we had been travelling for 2.5 weeks in our caravan, so had used the PUC for probably 10-12 days or so in that time and the card was about 25% full, so the microSD card should easily have capacity for a 1 month trip away from the home WIFI. That is of course dependent on the number of bird calls detected, but in two locations we stayed for over a week, the bird calls were pretty continuous.\nSo why would you choose a Birdweather PUC over a BirdNET-Pi given it’s more expensive? Well, if you are not comfortable building a Raspberry Pi computer, that could be a factor. If you want to take it with you travelling, bushwalking, etc then that may be another factor. The PUC is also weatherproof when operating on batteries (and they recommend special USB cables for weatherproof operation while powered by USB cable) so that could also be a factor when walking or doing field surveys.\nBoth the BirdNET-Pi and the Birdweather PUC are excellent solutions for continuous monitoring and identification of bird calls, and they share much of the same online technology.

    "text": "Commonly-used Sound Pressure level weightings\nOne of the challenges of infrasound assessment is that the pressure waveforms recorded by devices like the Raspberry Shake & Boom need to be converted in to Sound Pressure levels (SPL) measured on the logarithmic dB scale. There are various types of weighting used for such conversions, the most common being the db(A) weighting scale – see the chart of commonly-used SPL weightings in the margin.\nHowever, infrasound requires a quite different weighting to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear (and body, as infrasound at high levels can be felt as well as heard). This is called the G weighting scale, and looks like this:\nSoftware to carry out this weighting is not very common. However, after a bit of thought, a simple mechanism to achieve G weighting measurements has been found which does not require any high-level maths to understand. The idea is to create a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in dB(L) of the raw data, then apply the G weighting function to produce an FFT in dB(G).\nFirst I made sure the FFT in Pa was correctly normalised so it represents Pa. That is converted to dB(L), the G weighting is applied to the dB(L) to get dB(G). I’ve then converted the dB(G) back to Pa as an FFT (red plot in second axes). Now when I sum the FFTs I get a pressure in Pa which does not relate to levels in the signal unfortunately, but I am thinking the difference between these two summed pressures when convert back to dB is the difference overall between dB(L) and dB(G). It’s basically assuming the same frequency distribution across the whole sample period, which I think is the best we can hope to do without a real-time weighting circuit behind the microphone as the real SPL meters do. The estimated peak dB(G) is in the bottom right corner just above the peak dB(L). My tests show it works well in narrow band around 10Hz where dB(L) and dB(G) are the same. At this stage I can’t see any reason why there’d need to be another scaling factor in there."

    "text": "Post-Postscript\nAfter much deliberation, coding and testing, this project is maturing and looking promising. In the process the code has been developed into a Python module, so it can be used by multiple programs and scripts without retyping or copying the important parts of the code.\nIn the end, the final method chosen to apply the G weighting back to the time domain signal was to apply either an octave or 1/3 octave series of filters to the signal and use the maximum linear FFT value and the corresponding value in the G weighted FFT to scale the linear waveforms to G weighting. This solution was selected after it was realised the previous average of the difference would not work with a tonal signal. A signal at a single frequency has a lot of zero frequencies in the FFT and these need to be ignored when scaling the waveforms.\nThe current state of play with output from this package is shown in the reports below. There is a lot of information included in these reports which could of course be expanded into reports of their own, such as Octave Analysis, 1/3 Octave Analysis, etc. There is probably a need to add additional functionality into the module in future for things like Leq (averaged infrasound pressure level over a time period) but for now the module only handles instantaneous infrasound pressure levels. It is not anticipated that Leq functionality will be as challenging as the G weighting and octave and 1/3 octave band analysis functionality.\n\n\n\nExample Infrasound Report with G Weighting with 1/3 Octave Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n1/3 Octave Analysis Output (linear i.e. unweighted)\n\n\n\n\n\n1/3 Octave G Analysis G Weighted output\n\n\nThe waveforms from the 1/3 octave G weighted output are added together to reconstruct a single waveform with the G weighting applied in the time domain.\nSimilarly, the “test” plot in the Infrasound Report is the result of adding the linear 1/3 octave waveforms together. As can be seen it matches the original linear waveform well. This provides confidence that the reconstructed G weighted waveform is a reasonable approximation. This is further reinforced by close agreement between the Octave (not shown) and 1/3 Octave G weighting results, so the bandwidths of 1 and 1/3 of and octave are sufficient for repeatable results.\n\nThis is very much a work in progress. Further useful discussion of the need for G weighting of infrasound SPL data can be found starting at page 59 of this slightly dated but still very useful review report.\n\n\n\nCommonly-used Sound Pressure level weightings\nG weighting scale for infrasound\nTransform raw signal into a dB(L) FFT\nDerive and apply the G weighting function to obtain SPL in dB(G)\nTest of G-weighting on an infrasound signal from a quarry blast at Oberon Quarries\nNarrow time band around the strongest signal.\nBehaving as expected with narrow(er) bandwidth around 10Hz where dBL and DB(G) are close to the same.\nWith averaging of the difference between the dB(L) and dB(G) curves for the bandpass filter range only.\nExample Infrasound Report with G Weighting with 1/3 Octave Analysis\n1/3 Octave Analysis Output (linear i.e. unweighted)\n1/3 Octave G Analysis G Weighted output"

Absence of light pollution makes astronomy much easier, for obvious reasons. Light pollution is measured on the Bortle dark-sky scale, from 1 (absolutely dark) to 9 (inner city lights in a large brightly-lit city such as Tokyo). Outside of the towns, much or Oberon LGA is Bortle class 3 or lower, and many properties outside the towns are Bortle class 2 or even 1, which is highly-prized by amateur astronomers.\nthe elevation of much of the Oberon LGA mostly ranges between 1000m and 1300m above sea level. This means there is at least a kilometre less atmosphere to peer through to see distant stars and galaxies.\nAtmospheric distortion due to warm air rising is the enemy of astronomers. Oberon LGA has a cold climate, and during autumn and winter, the air can be remarkably cold and still (at least sometimes).\n\nTogether these three factors contribute to what astronomers call “good seeing” conditions, and the Oberon area possesses all three.",

    "section": "Types of Amateur Astronomy",
    "text": "Types of Amateur Astronomy\nThere are broadly four types of amateur astronomy:\n\nNaked eye observing, involves observing the night sky with just your eyes. The only equipment needed is a reclining chair or lounge or air mattress to allow you to lie comfortably while looking up. Such observing is best done on dark nights – that is, when there is a new moon or before the moon has risen, because the brightness of the moon tends to swamp the much fainter light from the stars. It usually takes 20 or 30 minutes in total darkness before your eyes become fully dark-adapted. When they do, on a dark night at a dark sky site (of which Oberon LGA is blessed with many), the Milky Way looks absolutely breathtaking.\nVisual observing, in which participants peer through the eyepiece of a telescope to view the moon, planets, star clusters and other deep space objects (whole galaxies, nebulae etc). Large telescopes which are able to collect a lot of light are usually used for visual observing, enabling observers to see night sky objects which are much too faint to see with the naked eye, and in the case of the moon and the planets, to see details and planetary moons which are not otherwise visible. Part of the thrill of visual observing is that you are seeing the actual light from the stars and planets, in many cases light photons which have been travelling for millions of years before they hit your retina. Part of the downside is that visual observing may involve standing around outside, at night, in pitch black so your eyes remain dark-adapted, sometimes in very cold weather (and the Oberon area does get very cold at night).\nElectronically assisted astronomy (EAA), which is similar to purely visual observing, but instead of physically looking through the eyepeice of a telescope, an electronic camera is used instead, and an image is built up over several minutes. This image is typically viewed on one or more laptop or tablet computers, linked via wi-fi. The advantages are that much fainter celestial objects can be seen, because the camera and the computer it is connected to can integrate light received over several minutes (which the human eye cannot do), and also observers can sit in comfort inside out of the cold, or around a firepit, rather than shivering in the dark. Nonetheless, the observing process is still quite spontaneous, with immediate results visible for participants.\nAstrophotography, which is like EEA but typically uses smaller telescopes on very high-precision automated mounts which very precisely adjust for the rotation of the Earth. Electronic cameras are then used to capture images over many minutes or hours, sometimes over the course of many nights, and often through different filters which emphasise different wavelengths (colours) of light emitted by different elements. These images are then combined and processed using sophisticated software to create a final image, often very spectacular. The cost of the equipment needed can be quite high, and the process takes time and patience.\n\nAs you can imagine, naked-eye astronomy, visual observing through a telescope (or astronomical binoculars) and EEA can be undertaken as social activities with lots of opportunity for learning and imparting a sense of wonder, as well as knowledge, about space and the universe. Astrophotography tends to be a more solitary activity, although many astronomy clubs organise events at dark-sky sites in which a mixture of visual, EEA and astrophotography activity is undertaken by members as a social activity.",

We hope to add several more such monitoring stations to the OCSN network in due course. A prototype all-sky camera is also being built, which will monitor the night sky continuously to record possible meteor trails. Once tested, we hope to deplot several more of these at various locations around Oberon LGA. The data and images they capture will all be publicly available.\n\n\n\n\n\nA commercial all-sky camera by All-Sky Optics in the UK. We are testing our own DIY versions of this type of device.\n\n\nMore information about this initiative will appear here in due course.",

    "text": "Current status of this initiative\n\n\n\nThis page is currently a place holder for some more concrete plans to establish an automated or semi-automated eco-acoustic monitoring network in key parts of Oberon SLA. More details to follow in due course.\nInspired by the capabilities of the Birdweather PUC and BirdNET-pi bird call monitoring stations, which are small computing devices which use machine learning (a limited form of artificial intelligence) to automatically detect and classify bird calls from audio they automatically record from attached microphones, OCSN plans to investigate the more general utility of eco-acoustics for ecological and biodiversity surveys in the Oberon region.\nOne of the problems with the Birdweather PUC and BirdNet-pi devices is that they require quite a lot of power to run (relatively speaking, in fact they use only a few watts, about as much as a small LED light bulb, which is very leittle, but quite a lot if it has to be supplied by batteries for any length of time). This makes them more suited to deployment near building which can supply 5 volt power to them continuously from a small mains-powered power supply unit (or via power-over-ethernet if they are connected via a network cable). The relatively high power requirement is due to the fact that the devices are doing edge computing, that is they are continuously evaluating (running) the machine learning models they use, and this requires quite a lot of computing power and hence electrical power.",
