    "text": "Wikipedia defines citizen science as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizen science (similar to community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, participatory monitoring, or volunteer monitoring) is research conducted with participation from the general public, or amateur/nonprofessional researchers or participants for science, social science and many other disciplines. There are variations in the exact definition of citizen science, with different individuals and organizations having their own specific interpretations of what citizen science encompasses. Citizen science is used in a wide range of areas of study including ecology, biology and conservation, health and medical research, astronomy, media and communications and information science.\n\n\nCitizen science has been around since the 1980s, and today there are thousands of citizen science groups around the worl, working on and participating in science projects and investigations ranging from…"

    "text": "This is the website for the recently formed Oberon Citizen Science Network (OCSN, pronounced “oxen”).\nOCSN is a collective of people living in and around the Oberon local government area (LGA) in the Central Tablelands of NSW who are interested in science and in participating in scientific investigation of interesting and/or important aspects of our environment. These include biology and ecology, and the impacts of human activity on those, as well as earth science, astronomy and any other safe and non-harmful scientific investigations members may wish to pursue. A list of current and potential activities and projects can be found in the list on the left. This list may expand or contract depending on the interests of OCSN participants.\nParticipants in OCSN do not need to be trained scientists – just having an interest in science and an allegiance to the scientific method (which is embodied in the mission statemnet and rules for the organisation) is enough. All projects and activities undertaken or promoted by OCSN will include trained scientists, acting in a voluntary capacity or, in some cases, in academic roles affiliated with universities and research institutes. The idea is to promote and transmit an appreciation of science and the scientific method to both OCSN participants and the wider community."
