One concern or consideration when evaluating such proposals is the effect which the wind farm construction and then the wind turbines themselves may have only the local environment and ecology. In order to assess such impacts, it is vital to record reliable, scientifically valid data on the prevalence of various bird species in areas around proposed wind farm sites. Ideally baseline data should be collected, before any construction starts, then comparable data during the construction phase and then during operation of these facilities, on an ongoing basis.\nIt appears that detailed bird species prevalence data has not been collected for the proposed wind farm site at Paling Yards, with the EIS relying on existing and very sparse ecology databases. This is a deficiency and data gap which ACSN members, in conjunction with university-based academic partners such as the QUT Ecoacoustics group, can potentially address.\n\n\n\nBirdWeather PUC",

    "text": "Ten Principles of Citizen Science\nOCSN seeks to adhere to and implement the ten principles of citizen science developed by researchers at a number of European and British universities, and adopted by the Australian Citizen Science Association. The formal paper describing the principles is available here, but in a nutshell they are:\n\nCitizen science projects actively involve citizens in scientific endeavour that generates new knowledge or understanding. Citizens may act as contributors, collaborators, or as project leader and have a meaningful role in the project.\nCitizen science projects have a genuine science outcome. For example, answering a research question, informing conservation action, or facilitating policy decisions.\nCitizen science provides benefits to both science and society. Benefits may include learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, the publication of research outputs, contributing to scientific evidence that can influence policy on many scales (locally, nationally, and internationally), and connecting the wider community with science.\nCitizen scientists may participate in various stages of the scientific process. This may include developing research questions, designing methods, gathering and analysing data, and communicating results.\nCitizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and the research, policy or societal outcomes.\nCitizen science, as with all forms of scientific inquiry, has limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However, unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides greater opportunity for public engagement and participation, increasing accessibility of science in society.\nWhere possible and suitable, project data and meta-data from citizen science projects are made publicly available and results are published in an open access format. Data sharing may occur during or after the project, unless there are security or privacy concerns that prevent this from occurring.\nCitizen scientists are suitably acknowledged by projects. This may include acknowledgement in project communications, result reporting and publications.\nCitizen science programs offer a range of benefits and outcomes which should be acknowledged and considered in project evaluation. Communication and evaluation of projects could include scientific outputs, data quality, participant experience and learning, knowledge sharing, social benefits, capacity building, new ways of science engagement, enhanced stakeholder dialogue, and wider societal or policy impact.\nThe leaders of citizen science projects take into consideration legal and ethical considerations of the project. These considerations include copyright, intellectual property, data sharing agreements, confidentiality, attribution, participant safety and wellbeing, traditional owner consultation, and the environmental impact of any activities.\n\n\nPresentation on the Ten Principles\nThis is a presentation in 2020 by Dr Sam Illingworth, who teaches science communication at the University of Western Australia:",

    "text": "Frogs and Wind farms\nOne of the reasons why it is so important to monitor frog populations is that they can be very vulnerable to human development and land use changes. For example, there is a proposed development of a large wind turbine farm at Paling Yards, which is in the catchment area of the Abercrombie River. There has been little or no consideration of the effect of wind farm development on the Booroolong frog in the Paling Yards development EIS (environmental impact statement). In fact, the Biodiversity Development Assessment Report for the Paling Yards Wind Farm notes on page 44 that no Booroolong frogs were recorded within 10km of the proposed development area, which appears to be at odds with idata collected by the FrogID project. There is clearly a role for local OCSN citizen scientists, working in collaboration with FrogID scientists, to check these facts.\nThere are also many other vulnerable or threatened species listed in the Bioversity Assessment Report for Paling Yards, including many bird species. There is a role for OCSN members to collect more data to better inform such environmental impact assessments – see also the proposed BirdNET sensor project.\n\n\n\nFrogID activities\nThe critically endangered Booroolong frog (Litoria booroolongensis)2\n\n\n\n\nen:user:Tnarg 12345, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons↩︎",

There are variations in the exact definition of citizen science, with different individuals and organizations having their own specific interpretations of what citizen science encompasses. Citizen science is used in a wide range of areas of study including ecology, biology and conservation, health and medical research, astronomy, media and communications and information science.\n\n\n\nCitizen science has been around since the 1980s, and today there are thousands of citizen science groups around the world, working on and participating in science projects and investigations ranging from collecting data on the local environment and wildlife to very ambitious projects such as CubeSats1.\n\n\nClosely related to citizen science is the concept of open science. Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.\n\n\n\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.2\n\n\n\nCitizen Science projects and activities\nTraditionally citizen science projects have focussed on monitoring and collecting data on the environment and local ecologies, with an emphasis on flora and fauna (plants and animals). We see such activities as key components of the OCSN program. Some examples of such activities can be found on this web site.\nHowever, we are also keen for OCSN to undertake some less usual projects, in particular projects which involve establishing a network of automated sensors for various things, which collect data continuously and make those data available through various platforms. On top of such data collection infrastructure, numerous secondary projects involving data analysis can be built. Such projects may be particularly attractive to schools. Some proposed sensor network projects are also described on this web site.\n\n\n\nSending an OCSN CubeSat into space is probably a bit ambitious at this stage, but atmospheric science projects using drones and ballons are not out-of-the-question, such as this model CubeSat designed by AustSTEM.↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎\n\n\n\n\nAll ages\nThe intention is for OCSN to promote, facilitate and host projects and activities which appeal to all ages, including children.3 Here is a cute video by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Behind The News team on young participants in citizen science initiatives.\n\n\n\n\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.4\n\n\n\n\nOCSN will adopt and enforce a suitable Working With Children Policy covering all its activities.↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎",

Absence of light pollution makes astronomy much easier, for obvious reasons. Light pollution is measured on the Bortle dark-sky scale, from 1 (absolutely dark) to 9 (inner city lights in a large brightly-lit city such as Tokyo). Outside of the towns, much or Oberon LGA is Bortle class 3 or lower, and many properties outside the towns are Bortle class 2 or even 1, which is highly-prized by amateur astronomers.\nthe elevation of much of the Oberon LGA mostly ranges between 1000m and 1300m above sea level. This means there is at least a kilometre less atmosphere to peer through to see distant stars and galaxies.\nAtmospheric distortion due to warm air rising is the enemy of astronomers. Oberon LGA has a cold climate, and during autumn and winter, the air can be remarkably cold and still (at least sometimes).\n\nTogether these three factors contribute to what astronomers call “good seeing conditions, and the Oberon area possesses all three.\nTo be completed…",
