These include biology and ecology, and the impacts of human activity on those, as well as earth science, astronomy and any other safe and non-harmful scientific investigations members may wish to pursue. A list of current and potential activities and projects can be found in the list on the left. This list may expand or contract depending on the interests of OCSN participants.\nParticipants in OCSN do not need to be trained scientists – just having an interest in science and an allegiance to the scientific method (which is embodied in the OCSN Mission Statement and OCSN Articles of Association for the organisation) is enough. All projects and activities undertaken or promoted by OCSN will include trained scientists, acting in a voluntary capacity or, in some cases, in academic roles affiliated with universities and research institutes. The idea is to promote and transmit an appreciation of science and the scientific method to both OCSN participants and the wider community.\nWith that out of the way, please do read on using the link below or the links at the left to learn more about OCSN and its aims and potential activities.",

There are variations in the exact definition of citizen science, with different individuals and organizations having their own specific interpretations of what citizen science encompasses. Citizen science is used in a wide range of areas of study including ecology, biology and conservation, health and medical research, astronomy, media and communications and information science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSCN star gazing activities\n\n\nCitizen science has been around since the 1980s, and today there are thousands of citizen science groups around the world, working on and participating in science projects and investigations ranging from collecting data on the local environment and wildlife to very ambitious projects such as CubeSats1.\n\n\nClosely related to citizen science is the concept of open science. Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.\n\n\n\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.2\n\n\n\nCitizen Science projects and activities\nTraditionally citizen science projects have focussed on monitoring and collecting data on the environment and local ecologies, with an emphasis on flora and fauna (plants and animals). We see such activities as key components\n\n\n\n\n\nFrogID activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting meteors\nOSCN star gazing activities\nPillars of the Open Science according to UNESCO’s 2021 Open Science recommendation.3\nFrogID activities\n\n\n\n\nSending an OCSN CubeSat into space is probably a bit ambitious at this stage, but atmospheric science projects using drones and ballons are not out-of-the-question, such as this model CubeSat designed by AustSTEM.↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎\nUNESCO.org, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons↩︎",
