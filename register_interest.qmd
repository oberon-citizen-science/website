:::

If you are interesting in joining the Oberon Citizen Science Network (OSCN), please register your interest using the online form [here](https://forms.gle/6HDzYWCqcRTkBsJ69). One of the founding members (Tim Churches or Alan Sheehan) will then contact you by email to confirm your details and place you on the OCSN mailing list. 

We hope to have gather sufficient expressions of interest from potential members by August 2024 to proceed to the next step of incorporating as a non-profit association. A modest annual membership fee may be required at that stage. 

Before registering your interest, please ensure you have read, or at least glanced at the [OCSN Mission Statement](ocsn_mission_statement.html) and [Code of Conduct](ocsn_code_of_conduct.html).
