If you are interesting in joining the Oberon Citizen Science Network (OCSN), please register your interest using the online form [here](https://forms.gle/6HDzYWCqcRTkBsJ69). Someone from the OCSN Management Committee will then contact you by email to confirm your details and place you on the OCSN mailing list.

We are now an incorporated non-profit association. You will be asked to pay a very modest joining fee (currently $10) and annual membership fee (also $10) within three months of your expression of interest to join, but we do not require you to pay immediately so you can decide whether you wish to become a financial member. We do not have a category for non-financial members. Student discounts are available. 

Before registering your interest, please ensure you have read, or at least glanced at the [OCSN Mission Statement](ocsn_mission_statement.html) and [Code of Conduct](ocsn_code_of_conduct.html).
