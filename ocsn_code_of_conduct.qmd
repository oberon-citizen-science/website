## Enforcement Responsibilities

OCSN community leaders (see [Articles of Association](ocsn_articles_of_association.html) for details) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments and posts on social media and other communication channels associated with OCSN that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Reasons for such moderation decisions will be communicated to the entire community where appropritae.

This Code of Conduct applies within all OCSN community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially or unofficially representing OCSNin public spaces. Examples of representing OCSNy include using an email address associated with OCSN, posting via an OCSN social media account, or acting as an appointed or self-appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to OCSN community leaders responsible for enforcement at the email addresses listed on the Contacts pages for this web site.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
